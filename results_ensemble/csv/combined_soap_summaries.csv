ASSESSMENT

Ms. Diane Baker is a 28-year-old female with a past medical history significant for depression, and hypertension, who presents for emergency room follow-up.

PLAN

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is not controlled at this time. The patient presented to the emergency department yesterday with an elevated blood pressure, presyncope, and headache. She has been compliant with lisinopril, but her blood pressures have been spiking once a month based on home monitoring; however, she admits to not taking her blood pressures while traveling recently. A recent EKG revealed changes from her chronic high blood pressure.
• Medical Treatment: Increase lisinopril to 40 mg once a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will continue to check her blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal. We will have to make adjustments if necessary.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well with weekly therapy.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current management strategies. No medication to start at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She can contact me if she needs anything.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I ended up going for a walk yesterday 'cause it was sunny and it was really great.

The patient states that over the weekend, he took a very long bike ride for approximately 3 hours, and when he returned, he was very lightheaded and short of breath. He notes that it was difficult to catch his breath afterward. He endorses that he had mild chest pain at that time, however, it eventually went away after about an hour. He denies any fever at this time or any other symptoms at this time. No other members in his family have been sick.

The patient is currently taking Imitrex as needed for his migraines. His migraines are under control and he avoids exposure to bright lights.

The patient is currently taking Protonix for his reflux and he is doing well with this.

The patient had cataract surgery about 4.5 months ago. He notes that his vision is okay since then.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: No fevers.
• Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses a cough. Endorses shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Endorses reflux.
• Neurological: Endorses migraines. Endorses lightheadedness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

CBC: Within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 61-year-old male who presents for shortness of breath.

Shortness of breath.
• Medical Reasoning: I reviewed the patient's chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, and labs which were all normal. He does have slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally on exam. I suspect his episode of shortness of breath was due to an exacerbation of asthma.
• Medical Treatment: I would like to prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.
• Specialist Referral: I have referred him to pulmonology for an asthma workup.

Acid reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This seems stable.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended the patient continue Protonix.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: This problem is also stable. Continue on Imitrex as needed.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended he continue Imitrex as needed for migraines.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow-up in 2 weeks or sooner if his conditions worsen.","S: took a very long bike ride, about three hours or and i got back, i was very light headed, i was short of breath it was hard to catch my breath afterwards maybe i did have a little chest pain but it eventually went away after about an hour if you have this shortness of breath again, i want you to call me away | O: all labs look quite good | A: migraines under control with Imitrex, reflux managed with Protonix, | P: shortness of breath no chest pain, no nausea or vomiting or abdominal pain, no one else sick in your family cataract surgery about four and a half months ago slight wheeze, expiratory wheeze, bilaterally trace lower extremity edema in your lower extremities normal chest x-ray, normal pulmonary function tests, may have had an asthma exacerbation from exercising and with the allergies prescribe albuterol inhaler, two puffs every four hours as needed for wheezing or for shortness of breath order a pulmonary referral see you in a couple weeks","The patient engaged in a three-hour long bike ride and upon returning, experienced symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath.

Anemia labs: Still pending.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Joyce Price is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure, who presents for follow up of abnormal labs.

1. Abnormal labs.
• Medical Reasoning: Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2. Her available anemia labs were normal, but we need to wait for her pending labs for a definitive anemia diagnosis.
• Additional Testing: I would like to obtain an endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
• Specialist Referrals: We will put in a referral to gastroenterology to perform her endoscopy and colonoscopy.

2. COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. She ceased tobacco use several years ago and continues to abstain from this.
• Medical Treatment: I do not think she needs any inhalers at this time. She should continue to stay away from smoking.

3. Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and continues to follow dietary modifications, particularly with limiting her sodium intake.
• Medical Treatment: Continue on Toprol and lisinopril, as well as her current dose of Lasix 20 mg a day.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: No swelling in your legs or anything? No blood in your stools at all? Are your stools dark or charry or black looking? Are you spotting a lot with your periods? Any weight loss? I hear a slight two out of six systolic heart, systolic ejection murmur on your heart exam. Your abdomen... had some tenderness to palpation in your lower quadrant on your abdominal exam. No lower extremity edema. Your hemoglobin level is 8.2. Somebody you should have a hemoglobin of about 13, 14. | O: I know the nurse told you about Dax. I'd like to tell Dax a little bit about you when we get started. I've been feeling really tired lately. Over the past couple of months, I've noticed that my energy has really gone down. I used to be really active... I've just been tired and exhausted and I haven't been able to really keep up with the way I was going with my exercise. I've noticed a little bit [weight loss], but that's because I've been doing really well with my exercise. I haven't been smoking. I quit cold turkey and I haven't gone back since. During the changes of season, it gets a little bit harder for me to breathe, but that's just because of my allergies. I've been doing really well with [diet]... staying away from the French fries, and all the other salty foods that I love to eat. I'm going to order an endoscopy and a colonoscopy just to make sure that you're not bleeding from inside your belly. Continue staying away from smoking. It doesn't sound like you need any inhalers at this time. I'm going to go ahead and order that referral to gastroenterology. My boyfriend is great and I have my brother down the road. I'll be in touch over the next week or so, and we'll get this all sorted out. | A: Your hemoglobin was low. No, not that I've noticed. No, not really. No, not that I've noticed. No, I'm not. I've noticed a little bit... You feel you have a good support system? | P: We need to investigate why it's low... some of your anemia labs are still pending at this time that's part of the workup. Continue you on the Toprol, continue you on the lisinopril and we'll continue you on your current diuretic dosing of 20, lasix 20 milligrams a day. I'll be in touch when those labs come back to see what further workup we need to do.","The patient reported no signs of swelling in their legs and no presence of blood in their stools. Their stools were described as being dark or charcoal in appearance, and they mentioned experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. The patient also reported some weight loss. During the physical examination, a faint systolic ejection murmur was detected in the patient's heart, and there was tenderness in the lower quadrant of their abdomen. No lower extremity edema was observed. The patient's hemoglobin level was measured at 8.2, which is significantly lower than the normal range of 13-14 g/dL.","The patient, whose name is Dax, has been experiencing fatigue and exhaustion for several months. Previously, Dax was active and engaged in regular exercise. However, recent energy levels have been low, making it difficult to maintain exercise routines. Dax has noticed some weight loss, which is likely due to increased focus on diet and exercise. There is no reported smoking history. Seasonal changes have caused some breathing difficulties, which are attributed to allergies. The patient has been successful in avoiding salty foods and has ordered endoscopy and colonoscopy tests to ensure there is no internal bleeding. Recommendations include continuing to avoid smoking and a referral to a gastroenterologist. Support systems include a caring boyfriend and a brother living nearby. The healthcare professional will provide further updates in the coming week.","The patient displayed signs of denial regarding their low hemoglobin levels during the assessment. Despite being informed of the diagnosis, the patient repeatedly denied noticing any symptoms or feeling unwell. When asked about their support system, the patient gave ambiguous responses, leaving room for further investigation into their emotional and social resources. Clinical reasoning suggests that the patient may be in denial due to fear, anxiety, or lack of understanding about the condition. Additional exploration of their emotional and psychological state, as well as their understanding of the diagnosis and its implications, is necessary to provide appropriate care and support.","The healthcare professional is currently investigating the cause of the patient's anemia, with some lab results still pending. In the meantime, the patient is to continue taking Toprol, lisinopril, and their current diuretic dosage of lasix 20mg daily. The healthcare professional will follow up with the patient once the lab results are available to determine any further necessary workup.","S: The patient reported no signs of swelling in their legs and no presence of blood in their stools.

Her right carpal tunnel release was performed a couple of years ago and she is back to work. She has full range of motion and it feels really good. No numbness or tingling in her hands.

She has had prior stenting for her heart and heart vessels in the past. Over the last month, she reports chest pain approximately 3-4 times a week with ambulation. Her chest pain does resolve with rest. The pain is described as burning and is located in the middle of her chest. She denies pain at rest.

She has had a little bit of nasal congestion from allergies. The patient denies, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or lower extremity edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Evelyn Morris is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc. She presents for her annual exam.

Status post right carpal tunnel release.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well postoperatively. She has returned to work and denies any recurrent symptoms.

Herniated disc.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been asymptomatic since receiving a steroid injection several months ago. I do not think we need to refer her for any further steroid injections or physical therapy at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: If she has any recurrent symptoms, she will let me know and we can take it from there.

Coronary artery disease.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports a burning chest pain with exertion approximately 3 times per week for the past month. Her recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Logan Harris is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery bypass grafting, hyperlipidemia, and OCD who presents today for upper respiratory symptoms.

COVID-19 Positive.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with upper respiratory symptoms and his COVID-19 test was positive today. He has received both doses of the vaccination. His symptoms seem to be very mild at this time. His oxygenation is good at 96%.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to quarantine for 10 days and we discussed that he should try to avoid family members. I asked him to call me if his symptoms worsen.

Hypercholesterolemia.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well on Crestor 20 mg once a day. His cholesterol looked good on his most recent lipid panel.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged him to continue to watch his diet.
• Additional Testing: We will go ahead and order another lipid panel for 6 months.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Crestor 20 mg once a day.

History of coronary artery bypass grafting.
• Medical Reasoning: He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting approximately 1 year ago. His coronary artery disease seems to be under control currently. He denies chest pain.
• Additional Testing: We will do a stress test in 6 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: about a week ago I started to get a cold.

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with some joint pain.

The patient reports he has been "" putting a few more miles on the bike each day "". His bilateral knees have been sore in the last 3 to 4 days. He states his bilateral knees are equally painful. He notes stiffness and soreness in the morning and, by the end of the day, he feels the same sensation. He endorses swelling and redness in his knees which reduces in severity by the afternoon. The patient denies any other associated fatigue. He denies any injury to his knees. He denies pain in any other joints including his elbows, wrists, or shoulders.

In regards to his coronary artery disease, Mr. Moore states he is compliant with his aspirin and Crestor. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient denies recent symptoms related to his lupus over the last year.

He denies fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomitting.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and erythema in bilateral knees.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: Edema and slight erythema of bilateral knees. Slight effusion of the right knee with pain to palpation. Decreased range of motion in bilateral knees.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. No bony abnormalities or fractures were noted.

Electrocardiogram stable in comparison to last year.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with some joint pain.

Lupus.
• Medical Reasoning: This has been stable and asymptomatic for the past year, but the patient reports increased joint pain and inflammation in his bilateral knees lately. ​His recent knee x-ray was unremarkable, so I am concerned that this is a lupus flare.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.

Coronary artery disease.
• Medical Reasoning: He is asymptomatic at this time. He has discontinued Plavix but continues with daily aspirin and Crestor. His recent EKG was unremarkable.
• Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel and a repeat echocardiogram.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: concerned that it might be from a flareup of your lupus | O: I’ve been putting a few more miles on the bike each day… my knees have been killing me, just more in the last three or four days swelling… redness… inflamed in the morning no other joints bothering you… just the knees taking aspirin every day… no problems with Crestor lupus… been in the background… no issues with kidney function EKG… looks really good, no concerns from a heart standpoint | A: no fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting coronary artery disease… stent placed last year bilateral edema and slight erythema… slight effusion present on the knee pain to palpation of the knee… decreased range of motion bilaterally 2/6 systolic ejection murmur… stable knee x-ray… no boney abnormality, no fracture | P: both equally stiff and sore order an autoimmune panel order a lipid panel and another echocardiogram continue current regimen no questions",The patient expresses worry that their current symptoms could be a result of a lupus flare-up.,"The individual has been increasing their cycling distance daily, leading to worsening knee symptoms over the past few days. The knees exhibit swelling, redness, and inflammation, primarily in the morning. No issues are reported with their Crestor medication for lupus or kidney function. An EKG examination reveals no heart concerns.","The patient presented with no signs of fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. There was a history of coronary artery disease with a stent placement the previous year. The patient exhibited bilateral edema and slight erythema. A slight effusion was present on the knee, causing pain to palpation. The range of motion in both knees was decreased to 2/6. A systolic ejection murmur was audible. A stable knee x-ray was obtained, revealing no bony abnormalities or fractures.

Clinical reasoning:
Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent stent placement, it is important to consider cardiac causes for the current presentation. However, the absence of fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, along with a stable knee x-ray, suggests that the current symptoms are not related to a cardiac event or a bony injury.

The presence of bilateral edema and slight erythema, along with a slight effusion on the knee, could suggest an inflammatory process such as arthritis. However","The two individuals, experiencing similar symptoms of stiffness and soreness, mutually decide to undergo further investigations. They both place orders for an autoimmune panel and a lipid panel, in addition to scheduling another echocardiogram. They continue with their current treatment regimen without raising any queries.","S: The patient expresses worry that their current symptoms could be a result of a lupus flare-up.

• Medical Reasoning: She is asymptomatic but her recent lab work demonstrated an elevated hemoglobin A1c of 8.1. She has been compliant with metformin 1000 mg daily, dietary modifications, and monitoring her blood glucose levels at home.
• Additional Testing: We will check her CBC, CMP, and lipid panel.
• Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg daily. Initiate Jardiance 10 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to follow her dietary modifications closely.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is stable and well-controlled on her current dose of lisinopril. She does monitor her blood pressures at home.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril at current dose.

Status post right ACL repair.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well postoperatively.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue with her physical activity and exercise regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: my blood sugars were high hemoglobin a1c is 8.1, which is elevated on metformin... 1000 milligrams a day lisinopril for that, that we should continue that add jardiance 10 mg a day follow your diet pretty aggressively | O: diet's been really great lately... avoiding sugars... power walking every day ACL repair... everything's been going far... no issues with mobility continue with your physical exercise... normal exercise regimen | A: Check up for abnormal labs. order a cbc, cmp, and lipid panel | P: no symptoms... no chest pain... no shortness of breath... no headaches... no belly pain systolic ejection murmur, about three over six... belly's nice and soft... no swelling","The patient's most recent blood sugar readings have been high, with an elevated hemoglobin A1c level of 8.1. Currently, they are taking Metformin at a dose of 1000 milligrams per day. To manage their blood sugar levels, the healthcare provider recommends continuing the use of Lisinopril, with a dose of 1000 milligrams. In addition, Jardiance, with a dose of 10 milligrams per day, has been prescribed. The patient is encouraged to follow a strict diet to help control their blood sugar levels effectively.","The individual's diet has shown significant improvement in recent times. They have been successful in avoiding sugars and have maintained a consistent routine of power walking every day. Following an ACL repair surgery, their mobility has been faring well with no reported issues. The healthcare provider encourages them to continue with their physical exercise regimen, as it is normal and beneficial for their overall health.","The healthcare provider suspected some underlying health issues based on the patient's symptoms and decided to conduct further investigations. To confirm any potential abnormalities, they ordered several lab tests for the patient. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) was requested to assess the status of the patient's red and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin levels. A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) was ordered to evaluate the patient's kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, glucose levels, and other metabolic parameters. Lastly, a lipid panel was requested to measure the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids in the patient's blood. The results of these tests would provide valuable insights into the patient's health status and help guide the healthcare provider's clinical decision-making.","The patient presents with no reported symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, or belly pain. A systolic ejection murmur, approximately three out of six, was detected during the physical examination. The patient's belly is soft with no observed swelling.

ASSESSMENT

Bruce Howard is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents for follow up of his chronic problems.

PLAN

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been doing well with going on morning walks; however, this has ended due to the cooler weather. He continues to decline the use of medications for this issue.
• Medical Treatment: We will defer initiating medication at this time.
• Specialist Referrals: I will refer him to psychiatry to engage in talk therapy.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient admits to recent dietary indiscretion. His most recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 8 percent. He is compliant with metformin.
• Additional Testing: I will order a repeat hemoglobin A1c in the next couple of months. I will also order a lipid panel.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice a day.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been monitoring his blood pressure on a regular basis. Blood pressure is well controlled at this time. He has a systolic ejection murmur that continues to be heard on exam.
• Additional Testing: I will order an echocardiogram to reassess the heart murmur.
• Medical Treatment: He will continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I'm gon na go ahead and increase the metformin to 1000 milligrams twice a day a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base, which we've heard in the past you do have one plus non-pitting edema bilaterally in your lower extremities refer you to psychiatry not for medications, but just for some talk therapy that type of thing no.

This assessment was based on the provider's clinical judgment, taking into account several factors. The Hemoglobin A1c test measures the average level of blood sugar over the previous two to three months, providing valuable information about the patient's diabetes management. The lipid panel, on the other hand, assesses various lipids, including cholesterol and triglycerides, to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular health risk. By ordering these tests, the healthcare provider aims to monitor the patient's diabetes control and cardiovascular risk status, adjusting treatment plans as necessary to maintain optimal health.","The patient is currently hesitant about trying medications for their elevated hemoglobin A1c level, which stands at eight. Instead, they are exploring alternative options. The healthcare provider acknowledges the patient's efforts and encourages them to continue their current approach.

Follow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.

The patient’s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.

She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.

The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.

Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.

She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.

The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Peripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Current tobacco smoker.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Metoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Amlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Atorvastatin tablet.
Metformin.
Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.

VITALS

Blood pressure 140/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
No rasping, wheezing.

Cardiovascular
Normal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.

Gastrointestinal
No nausea or vomiting.

Extremities
Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.
Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.

ASSESSMENT

• Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Peripheral vascular disease.

PLAN

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don’t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.

Peripheral vascular disease
I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.

Hypertension
Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.

Hyperlipidemia
I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.","S: your sugars are not very controlled I just got new glasses Not happy with this lens ; it's kinda funny.

"[doctor] patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
[doctor] hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?
[patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
[doctor] so it's in both of your hands ?
[patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
[doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
[doctor] constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
[patient] yep , that's all correct .
[doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[doctor] okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[doctor] all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
[patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[doctor] and how about the left side ?
[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
[doctor] all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?
[doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[patient] that sounds fine to me .
[doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .
[patient] thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Numbness and tingling of both hands.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.
• Eyes: Floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.
• Respiratory: Shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.
• Endocrine: Excessive hunger.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up after EMG testing.","S: numbness and tingling of both hands broken them [both wrists] in a motor vehicle accident last december splint helps.

Upon physical examination, the healthcare provider observed signs of carpal tunnel syndrome or cubital tunnel syndrome.

In the case of carpal tunnel syndrome, the provider noted the following objective findings:
- Decreased sensation to light touch in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers on both hands
- Weakened grip strength, particularly noticeable when holding small objects
- Tineling or paresthesia (abnormal sensations) in the affected fingers, especially when the wrists were flexed or extended

Upper extremity tingling

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 60-year-old female referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began last December after she broke both wrists in an MVA and which has progressively worsened since then. She continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which she states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the MVA. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. She states that her fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. She denies complete loss of sensation in any of her fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. she reports mild stiffness in her neck. She notes that she did hit her head during the MVA and was diagnosed with a contusion. She states that she has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

The patient takes carvedilol for her hypertension and Lexapro for her anxiety. She reports a history of prediabetes, which she has brought under control via dietary changes. She denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS

• Eyes: Positive for floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Positive for leg swelling.
• Respiratory: Positive for shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Positive for excessive hunger and bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Positive for gout and muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Positive for nail bed changes, dryness, and itching.
• Neurological: Positive for bilateral paresthesia of hands.
• Endocrine: Positive prediabetes and excessive hunger.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Prediabetes, diet controlled.
Hypertension.
Gastric esophageal reflux disorder (GERD)

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Carvedilol 25 mg twice daily.
Lexapro 10 mg daily.

ALLERGIES

Sulfa, causes rash.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological Exam
Sensation is normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right and the 4th and 5th fingers on the left. 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes are downgoing bilaterally. Tinel's sign positive at both wrists and both elbows.

RESULTS

CT brain with and without contrast, 02/05/2021
Impression: No metastatic disease. No acute intracranial abnormalities. I personally reviewed the report and images.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, question of bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

I discussed my impression with the patient. I will schedule her for EMG/NCV. If her symptoms do not resolve, we can consider Hand Clinic referral for possibly symptomatic injections or carpal tunnel release surgery, although she can also pursue these through her current orthopedist. I encouraged her to wear her splints.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return for EMG/NCV.","S: Ever since my car wreck last December when I broke them, once they healed, I noticed it more—the tingling and numbness. Both have gotten worse over the last month. The splint seems to help. I wear the left one also sometimes. On the right, I can really notice it from my middle and ring finger all the way up to my forearm, and on my left, a bit more the pinky and the ring and not the middle. Really, just more at night, and it just comes and goes throughout the day. Feeling something? No, not that I can think of really. In general, they might be less sensitive than they should be, but I can still feel. I had pre-diabetes, but I got it under control changing my diet. | O: Sensations normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the third and fourth fingers on the right and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees, toes are downgoing bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and both elbows. No metastatic disease. No acute intracranial abnormalities. | A: I’ve been having some mild stiffness in my neck too. I hit my head during the accident, and they told me it was a contusion. Mainly just sore. Sometimes they throb, but overall, they feel weaker too, especially when I’m using them. The tingling happens some more, but when they hurt, it goes away and the tingling’s just dull. They gave me some nerve pain medicine, but I haven’t been taking it. I should be. I’m still taking those [carvedilol and Lexapro]. Sulfa just causes me to break out in a rash. | P: I discussed my impression with the patient. I will schedule her for EMG/NCV. If her symptoms do not resolve, we can consider Hand Clinic referral for possible symptomatic injections or carpal tunnel release surgery, although she can pursue these through her current orthopedist. I encouraged her to wear her splints.","The patient, who was involved in a car accident last December resulting in finger injuries that required splinting, has reported experiencing intermittent tingling and numbness sensations in both hands since their healing. These symptoms have worsened over the past month. The right hand exhibits more pronounced numbness from the middle finger up to the forearm, while the left hand experiences it more in the pinky and ring finger. The symptoms are more noticeable at night and can come and go throughout the day. The patient denies experiencing any constant pain or loss of sensation, but acknowledges that the affected fingers may be less sensitive than usual. The patient had previously been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, but has managed to control it through dietary changes.","The patient's physical examination revealed normal sensations, except for a diminished pinprick sensation in the third and fourth fingers on the right hand, and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left hand. Reflexes were found to be 1+ and symmetric, with 2+ reflexes observed in the knees. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. Tinel's sign was positive at both wrists and both elbows. No evidence of metastatic disease was detected, and there were no signs of acute intracranial abnormalities.","The patient has reported experiencing mild neck stiffness following a head injury during an accident, diagnosed as a contusion. They describe the sensation as sore, with occasional throbbing and weakness, particularly during use. Tingling sensations are also present, although they subside when the pain intensifies, leaving a dull sensation. The patient has been prescribed nerve pain medication but has not been consistently taking it. They continue to take carvedilol and Lexapo, but are allergic to sulfa, causing a rash. The patient's clinical presentation suggests a possible nerve injury or damage from the head injury, with symptoms of pain, weakness, and tingling. The healthcare professional may consider further evaluation, such as imaging or nerve conduction studies, to assess the extent of any neural damage and determine an appropriate treatment plan. The patient's reluctance to take prescribed medication may need to be addressed to ensure effective management of their symptoms.","The healthcare professional shared their assessment with the patient and recommended scheduling an Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) test. If the patient's symptoms persist after the test, they may consider a referral to a Hand Clinic for potential symptomatic injections or carpal tunnel release surgery.

[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.

The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.

Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Anxiety.

Surgical
Surgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”

Procedures
Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Works as a paralegal.

FAMILY HISTORY

Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

ALLERGIES

Seasonal environmental allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.
• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.
• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.

• GERD
• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

PLAN

• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.
• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.
• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.
• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.
• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.
• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.
• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.
• Schedule EGD.
• Call with any changes or problems.
• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.","S: I've had acid reflux since I was around 12, but it has gotten worse over the past few years.

[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Quadriplegia.
Spinal cord injury.
Hypertension.
Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

INSTRUCTIONS

Labs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.","S: The cultures are not very impressive. Inflammation can do that... backed up and inflamed. We'll repeat the CBC to ensure it trends downward. I wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count? typically, it doesn't. I recommend combining MiraLAX with lactulose as a rescue. | O: I really don't think it was a UTI. I felt much better when I got home and finally pooped. I told them when I was admitted, and they did X-rays and everything, but they said, 'no.' I take MiraLAX every day... when I don't go, I double up on that. I have it [lactulose]... it takes about two days to work and it's a brutal two days. I'm unvaccinated... we don't know the side effects... vaccine injury... I'm young and healthy enough to beat it... take vitamin C and multivitamins. You're high risk... I've seen people die from COVID... vaccine is safe. I've had healthy people die from COVID. She is hesitant about the vaccine... considers herself homeopathic in some viewpoints. | A: if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further worsening constipation issues. She believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia, from her quadriplegia that typically occurs. Her leukocytosis may have been due to inflammation from constipation. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered for CBC and cholesterol in 2-3 weeks. | P: The virus is becoming more contagious but less deadly... pandemics end this way. The only true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine... supplements are not necessarily going to help. the virus starts losing its potency... how most pandemics end.","The patient reported unimpressive culture results, which could be attributed to inflammation and an accompanying backlog. The healthcare provider suggested repeating a Complete Blood Count (CBC) to monitor the trend of inflammation. The provider pondered if autonomic dysreflexia could influence the white blood cell count, but typically, it does not. The provider recommended using a combination of MiraLAX and lactulose as a remedy for constipation.","The patient expressed her doubts about having a urinary tract infection (UTI) due to feeling better after returning home and passing stools. She mentioned undergoing X-rays during her hospitalization, but the medical professionals did not confirm a UTI diagnosis. The patient revealed her daily consumption of MiraLAX for bowel movement regularity and use of lactulose when necessary, which she described as a lengthy and uncomfortable process. She also disclosed her unvaccinated status, expressing concerns about vaccine injury but acknowledging the safety of the vaccine. The patient considered herself healthy and young, expressing her intention to boost her immunity through vitamin C and multivitamins. She displayed hesitancy towards vaccination and held homeopathic views.","The patient's constipation issues may have been exacerbated by dehydration. This dehydration could have contributed to her recent hospitalization. The patient suspects that her hospitalization was mainly due to dysreflexia, a complication of her quadriplegia. Her elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) could potentially be a result of inflammation caused by constipation. Further laboratory tests, including a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and cholesterol assessment, have been scheduled for the patient in the coming weeks.","As the virus continues to spread, it becomes more contagious but less deadly, following the typical pattern of pandemics coming to an end. The most effective preventative measure against COVID-19 remains the vaccine. Although supplements may not be ineffective, they are not a substitute for vaccination. Eventually, the virus begins to lose its potency, contributing to the natural decline of the pandemic.","S: The patient reported unimpressive culture results, which could be attributed to inflammation and an accompanying backlog.

"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-

Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had ""a lot of infections"". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.

Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.

When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.

The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.

FAMILY HISTORY

Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.
Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.

No family history of polycystic kidney disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Pepcid 40 mg once daily.
Claritin as needed for allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Well-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.

Neurological
Alert.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.
CT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.
CMP, 03/22/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Renal hypoplasia.
Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.

PLAN

Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.

The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.",,,,,,"S:

Low back pain, left side.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.

The patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, left side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.",S: disk broke off and just wrapped around and connected to my spinal thecal sac horrible nerve pain down my leg in my back just horrible awful things muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine | O: status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020 no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities... previous surgical site healed properly | A: lower left back pain when was your back surgery pain with weight-bearing pain with palpation to the left side around the L5 | P: highly highly dosed up on gabapentin ibuprofen 800 milligrams a day prescribe some physical therapy... meloxicam instead of ibuprofen requested some Vicodin... prescribed Demerol refer to pain management for narcotics,"The patient described experiencing a broken disc that wrapped around and connected to their spinal thecal sac, resulting in intense nerve pain in their leg and lower back.

[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions
[patient] i do not no that sounds great
[doctor] okay","CHIEF COMPLAINT

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Reports visual distortions and blurred vision.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Eyes
- Examination: Anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes.
Right eye: The cornea is clear. No MVI. PCIOL cup to disc is 0.2. Fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached 360 degrees without any tears or holes. RPE changes in the fovea. Posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula, thickening of the retina, presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation. Positive for hemorrhage.
Left eye: The cornea is clear. No MVI. Cup to disc is 0.3. RPE changes in the fovea. No hemorrhage or subretinal fluid. Retina is attached.

RESULTS

Optical coherence tomography shows drusen deposit. Retinal pigment epithelium with subretinal fluid accumulation. The choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized. Fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

[doctor] you can have a piece here and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay
[patient] okay yeah i've been eating a lot of vegetables and and chicken without salt on it
[doctor] okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety were the denver denver nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the nba playoffs i forget i know that you are a denver nuggets fan

[doctor] okay
[patient] do you think that i can swim again i miss swimming
[doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do
[patient] yeah i think i have to
[doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay

Follow up.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports an myocardial infarction.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports stent placement in the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient is a fan of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. He also enjoys swimming.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Brilinta twice a day every 12 hours, aspirin 81 mg at night, Crestor 40 mg once a day, and Toprol 50 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath with exertion.
Skin: Denies redness or infection in the right wrist.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 127/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. No gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Right radial artery cardiac catheterization site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable radial pulse.

RESULTS

The ejection fraction, obtained while he was hospitalized, was measured at approximately 50%, which is in the low normal range.

I reviewed the patient’s recent echocardiogram which demonstrates mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. His catheterization site is healing well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of continuing to take his medications to prevent the stent from clogging again and to reduce his chance of another heart attack. I encouraged him to limit his salt intake as an increased amount of sodium can affect the ejection fraction measurement of his heart function.
- Medical Treatment: The patient is taking a low-dose aspirin, and will continue taking it for life or until he is instructed to discontinue. Continue Brilinta for at least 1 year. Continue Crestor 40 mg once a day. Continue Toprol 50 mg once a day. The patient can resume swimming a few laps. He will enroll in cardiac rehab to gain confidence in returning to exercising and for dietary education and counseling. Liver function studies and lipid panel ordered. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be performed in 6 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

The patient has resumed swimming and intends to undergo another echocardiogram in approximately six months.","During the physical examination, a faint three out of six systolic ejection murmur was detected at the left base of the heart. This finding indicates some degree of obstruction or turbulence in blood flow as the heart contracts. Additionally, mild mitral regurgitation was noted. Mitral regurgitation is a condition where there is leakage of blood from the mitral valve, causing a backward flow of blood into the left atrium during the contraction of the left ventricle. Together, these findings suggest the presence of some degree of heart valve dysfunction.","The patient's ejection fraction was measured at around fifty percent during the assessment. This value falls within the low normal range, indicating some degree of impairment in the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. However, a fifty percent ejection fraction is not considered severely low and poses less risk compared to lower values.

[patient] alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here
[doctor] okay

[doctor] okay
[patient] alright then
[doctor] i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here
[patient] is this where it hurts
[doctor] yeah like when you touch it it really hurts
[patient] right there okay tell me what's worse here or here
[doctor] on the inside
[patient] okay so medial joint line tenderness
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here
[doctor] no i do n't think so
[patient] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side
[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks
[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it
[doctor] all the way back
[patient] okay let's see
[doctor] okay
[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too
[doctor] yeah that's fine
[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax
[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee
[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
[doctor] okay
[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
[doctor] yeah sometimes
[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] you actually no
[doctor] yeah it hurts no
[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak
[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls
[doctor] no no
[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] okay
[doctor] bye
[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay
[doctor] yes sir
[patient] alright very good any questions at all
[doctor] no
[patient] okay so","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Beverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.

The patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in a Children's Hospital.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm, dry and intact
MSK: 
Examination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.
Examination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.

As an alternative to previous prescription, the healthcare team suggests trying a different treatment method. The patient's reported weakness rather than pain is taken into consideration.

VITALS

The patient's blood pressure today is 150/90.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Slight murmur detected, not heard before.

ASSESSMENT

Left arm pain.
Type 2 diabetes.
Hypertension.

PLAN

Regarding his left arm pain, I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely a mild heart attack. I have recommended that we obtain an EKG for further evaluation. I have also recommended that the patient take aspirin and nitroglycerin for pain. The patient will follow up with me once the EKG results are available for review and further discussion.

In regards to his diabetes, the patient will continue the 500 mg of metformin for now.

For his hypertension, the patient will continue the 2.5 mg of Norvasc.",S: from my elbow all the way up to the neck not really still kinda comes and goes and aches chest pain comes with the elbow pain arm pain it kinda goes up my neck sometimes too i do n't check them | O: achiness achiness heaviness some motrin one twenty five over seventy two | A: i just woke up one day it was hurting no nothing nothing really unusual mowed grass and that's about it slight murmur with your heart here and i don't think we've heard that before blood pressure is a little bit high it was one fifty over ninety | P: concerned you might be having a mild heart attack aspirin and nitroglycerin denies any shortness of breath,"The patient experiences intermittent discomfort in their elbow that radiates up to their neck.

[doctor] okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine
[patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual
[doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently

[doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently
[patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic
[doctor] okay
[patient] so
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare
[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been
[patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies
[doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that
[patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great
[doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain
[patient] i've had some chills but no documented fevers
[doctor] okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Cough.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms similar to an upper respiratory infection. Most likely it is a virus that is causing her symptoms, especially as she reports being around some else with similar symptoms.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that we often let the virus run its course while we treat her symptoms. I advised her to be cautious with over-the-counter cough medicines as certain ones can affect her blood pressure and diabetes.
- Medical Treatment: She increase her fluid intake. I recommended she try Coricidin HBP as a safer alternative to her cough medicine. The patient should rest frequently. I will order a COVID-19 test.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue with dietary restrictions.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue her on her metformin 500 mg twice a day. Repeat hemoglobin A1c will be due at her next visit.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Her blood pressure is elevated today, and it sounds like it has been trending higher at home as well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue limiting her intake of salty foods. >I recommend that she take her hydrochlorothiazide in the morning because it can result in more frequent urination.
- Medical Treatment: We will increase her dose of hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg once a day. She will continue checking her blood pressure a few times a week at different times of the day.

[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Rogers is a pleasant 50-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain.

For the past few weeks, the patient has been experiencing constant pain isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed. If her symptoms do not improve, we can consider administering a steroid injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S: I’ve been doing a lot with renovating my basement Can’t even raise my arm over my head because that’s it—it really hurts The pain is always there… when I sleep directly on it the pain goes up Without any Tylenol my pain is a seven… with Tylenol it goes down to a two or three I’m really active—do you think that this pain will ever go away?

The pain is localized and prevents the patient from raising their arm above their head. The pain is persistent and worsens when the patient sleeps directly on the affected area. Without the use of Tylenol, the patient reports a pain level of seven out of ten. With Tylenol, the pain is reduced to a level of two or three.

Right knee pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Allen is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of his pain began yesterday after he went up for a rebound while playing basketball and felt a pop in his knee. He states that he experienced swelling and difficulty with ambulation following this incident. He locates his pain today to the medial aspect of his knee. His pain is described as aching and is rated at 4 out of 10. In terms of his swelling, he states that this has improved some. He is also able to weight-bear, but he finds that he is favoring his left leg while doing so. His tried treatments include Tylenol with some relief as well as rest.

The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. He reports that he does not check is blood pressure at home very often, but he typically runs 140 to 150 range over 80. He is taking 5 mg of Norvasc daily. In terms of his diet, he states that he enjoys eating whatever he likes. His most recent A1C was 7.2. He is taking metformin 500 mg daily, however there are days where he skips this because of gastrointestinal upset. He denies checking his blood sugar at home consistently and that when he does check he has been around 150.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of hypertension and diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports playing basketball, however this most recent event was the first time he played in 2 years.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports he is taking Norvasc 5 mg daily, metformin 500 mg daily, and Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.

VITALS

Blood pressure is 140/80 today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Pain with palpation over the medial aspect. Mild pain with flexion and extension. Edema, swelling, and ecchymosis noted. Mild redness. Negative varus and valgus stress test with firm endpoint.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee MCL strain.
Diabetes.
Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to further evaluate for a possible MCL tear. In the meantime, he will continue with Tylenol for pain relief. I have also prescribed him meloxicam 15 mg for pain and swelling. He will be placed into a knee immobilizer and has been advised to remain non weight-bearing for the next couple of weeks.

In terms of his diabetes, he was advised to start logging his blood sugars daily and to avoid eating large amounts of strawberries. He will also be provided with a referral for a consult with a nutritionist.

For his hypertension, we are going to increase his Norvasc to 5 mg daily as his blood pressures have been elevated. We discussed our goal is for him to get closer to the 120/80 range.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review his MRI results.",S: when I came down and I felt my knee just popped it started swelling and I could hardly walk when it happened it feels it's on the inside of the knee I tried some tylenol yesterday your a1c... was a seven point two i skip it [metformin] because it upsets my stomach consult nutrition... get your diet a little bit better strawberries can lower your blood pressures... but [they have] a lot of sugar | O: pain to palpation of the medial aspect... edema... ecchymosis x-ray... no fractures no bony abnormalities mcl strain... need an mri to determine if torn knee immobilizer... stay off of that for the next couple of weeks follow up in two weeks to review your mri results | A: about a four first time in two years grade two out of systolic ejection murmur negative varus and valgus test | P: your blood pressures been running today... one forty over eighty blood sugars... probably about a hundred and fifty prescribe... meloxicam fifteen milligrams up your norvasta... to lower blood pressure to one twenty over eighty check your blood sugars daily... log book,"The patient described experiencing a knee injury, where they felt a popping sensation followed by significant swelling and difficulty walking. The pain was localized to the inside of the knee. The patient attempted to manage the discomfort with over-the-counter pain medication (Tylenol) but reported skipping their metformin medication due to gastrointestinal side effects. Additionally, the patient mentioned their A1C level was 7.2, and they were advised to consult a nutritionist to improve their diet. The patient shared that strawberries, although beneficial for lowering blood pressure, contain a high sugar content.","The patient was found to have pain upon palpation of the medial aspect of the knee. Edema and ecchymosis were observed during the physical examination. An x-ray was conducted, which revealed no fractures or bony abnormalities. However, a medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain was diagnosed. An MRI scan is required to determine the extent of the injury and whether the ligament is torn. The patient is advised to avoid putting weight on the affected knee for the next few weeks and has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the MRI results.","The patient presented with a grade 2 out-of-systolic ejection murmur during the physical examination, marking their first visit in the past two years. The cardiovascular assessment included negative varus and valgus tests. These findings suggest that the patient may have an ejection murmur, likely related to a benign condition such as a small patent ductus arteriosus or a bicuspid aortic valve. However, further investigations, such as an echocardiogram, are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any more serious underlying conditions. The negative varus and valgus tests indicate that the patient's lower extremities are not causing any abnormal forces on the heart, which is a good sign. Overall, the assessment indicates that the patient requires additional testing to determine the cause of their ejection murmur and ensure appropriate management.","The patient's blood pressure readings have been high today, with a reading of 140/80. Their blood sugar levels are estimated to be around 150. The healthcare provider has prescribed meloxicam at a dose of 15mg to help lower the patient's blood pressure to a target of 120/80.

[doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still
[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day
[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound
[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things
[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me

- Auscultation of Heart: Grade 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Elevated blood pressure.
- Medical Reasoning: I do think his blood pressure is uncontrolled and we need to make some adjustments to his medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he should stay well hydrated during warm weather. I explained he loses more fluid when perspiring and will need to increase his fluid intake as needed. We discussed that drinking 6 to 8 standard glasses of water per day is an adequate amount. He may want to increase that amount if he is feeling particularly dehydrated or as he increases his activity level. I cautioned him from drinking more than 2 alcoholic beverages a week.
- Medical Treatment: I am going to increase his lisinopril to 60 mg twice per day. Prescription for 25 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide provided as well. He will check his blood pressure twice a day for the next 2 weeks.

2. Hyperlipidemia.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Medical Treatment: I will order a cholesterol panel, CBC with differential, and comprehensive metabolic panel. We will also obtain an urinalysis to assess his kidney function as well. He will continue the current management with his atorvastatin.

3. Osteoarthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to stay as active as he can without overdoing it. We discussed that walking and golfing are great activities for him to engage in.
- Medical Treatment: He can take Tylenol for any mild pain.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis
[doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad
[patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though
[doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking
[patient] what type of smoking
[doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but
[patient] okay
[doctor] have you smoked
[patient] next maybe that i have n't
[doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
[patient] okay i smoked
[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Steven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago after he fell and landed onto his back while playing basketball. His pain is rated at 7 out of 10 and is described a sharp with occasional throbbing. At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Genitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.
Musculoskeletal: Reports back pain.

VITALS

Oxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No Murmur.
NEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Chronic lumbar back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.","S: Midline tenderness on the L4 L5 disc space with sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Supine straight leg test positive. Decreased sensation to light touch at the lateral thigh at L4 dermatome.

Played basketball and I bumped one time and I fell and I hit I fell on my back real hard. Pain is around a seven... sharp... throbs sometimes. Radiates down my left leg... my toes get numb a little sometimes. Standing for too long makes me weak... lying on my side makes me feel better. I pooped myself once... drinking too [when it happened].

They report midline tenderness at the L4 L5 disc space, accompanied by paravertebral tenderness on the affected side. Pain is aggravated with both lumbar flexion and extension. The supine straight leg test reveals a positive result. Sensation to light touch is decreased at the lateral thigh, corresponding to the L4 dermatome. Neurological findings are consistent with a herniated disc at the L4 L5 level, resulting in moderate neural foraminal stenosis and radiculopathy. The MRI confirms disc desiccation, disc bulge, and paracentral disc herniation.","The individual has been experiencing back pain for approximately two years, which has persisted despite trying various interventions.

An unfortunate incident of fecal incontinence occurred, and this was possibly linked to a period of increased inactivity and excessive food intake, leading to a weight gain of around 80 pounds over the past year. The person's daily routine now includes spending most of their time at home, watching TV, and maintaining a sedentary lifestyle.","The patient expressed apprehension towards recent medical interventions that involved injections. They mentioned having received unspecified injections and described feeling the need for someone to hold them down during the procedure. The patient also mentioned encountering a white pill but was uncertain about its identity and purpose. The patient expressed a strong preference for oral medication over injections, stating that they did not want needles. Clinical reasoning suggests that the patient may have a diagnosis of needlestick phobia or injection anxiety, which is a common and treatable condition characterized by intense fear and avoidance of injections. The healthcare provider may consider offering oral medications or other alternative methods for administration when possible, and providing supportive measures to help the patient manage their anxiety during necessary injections.","The individual is undergoing physical therapy to help manage their scoliosis, which is not hereditary in their direct family.

Right shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sharon Wright is a pleasant 36-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain. The onset of her pain began 3 weeks ago, when she was painting on a ladder when she reached out to catch herself because she fell. She states that she braced herself with her right arm. The patient reports that she was able to get up and continue painting. She states that she experienced numbness and tingling in her arm and hand when she initially injured her right shoulder, however this has resolved. She states that she iced her arm and took Advil for pain. The patient denies any previous shoulder pain. She reports constant pain with lifting her arm overhead. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10 without medication and a 4 out of 10 with medication.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Positive right shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness and tingling.

VITALS

Vitals look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Brisk capillary refill of less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Normal strength and sensation. Neurovascularly intact distally. Equal bilateral response to sensation and touch.
MSK: Examination of the right shoulder reveals limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness over the sternoclavicular joint. Good strong bilateral hand grips.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right shoulder taken today reveals no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder. I referred her to formal physical therapy to strengthen her right shoulder. She will continue to take Advil as needed for pain.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks for re-evaluation.",S: rotator cuff tendinopathy steroid injection | O: limited active and passive range of motion tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus no fracture or bony abnormality | A: I was up on a ladder painting and kinda reaching out and fell took a fall and kinda braced myself but I was painting. I iced the arm and I also took some Advil. I did when I initially hurt it but I'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling. | P: this happened about three weeks ago pain all the time about a six down to about a four order an MRI of that shoulder refer you to physical therapy six to eight weeks continue to take an NSAID see you again in two weeks,"The patient reported experiencing symptoms of rotator cuff tendinopathy, which is characterized by pain, tenderness, and inflammation in the shoulder area. The condition is often caused by repetitive motions or overuse, leading to degeneration or injury of the rotator cuff tendons. The patient described the pain as a persistent ache in the shoulder, which worsened with movement and was particularly noticeable at night.

In an attempt to alleviate the symptoms, the patient underwent a steroid injection as part of their treatment plan. Steroid injections are a common intervention for rotator cuff tendinopathy, as they help reduce inflammation and can provide significant pain relief. The injection was administered by a healthcare professional, typically under ultrasound guidance, to ensure accurate placement in the affected area. The patient was advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities following the injection to allow the medication time to take effect. The use of steroid injections is not a long-term solution, but rather a means of providing short-term pain relief and reducing inflammation, allowing the patient to engage in more comprehensive rehabilitation programs to address the underlying cause of their condition.","The physical examination revealed restricted active and passive range of motion in the affected shoulder. Tenderness was noted upon palpation of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. However, no fracture or bony abnormalities were detected during the examination.","The individual was engaged in painting while on a ladder when they experienced a fall. Upon impact, they attempted to break their fall by bracing themselves. Following the incident, they applied ice and took Advil for pain relief. Currently, they report no longer experiencing any numbness or tingling in the affected area.

Clinical Reasoning: Based on the information provided, it is likely that the individual has sustained an injury to their upper extremity. The absence of numbness or tingling suggests that there is no nerve damage, but further assessment is necessary to determine the extent of soft tissue injury. The use of ice and Advil for pain management is appropriate in the acute phase of injury. A thorough physical examination, including range of motion and strength assessment, is recommended to evaluate the severity of the injury and determine if any further interventions, such as immobilization or physical therapy, are necessary. Additionally, it is essential to consider any underlying medical conditions or risk factors that may influence the healing process and potential complications.","Approximately three weeks ago, the patient experienced constant pain in their shoulder, rated at a six out of ten on the pain scale, which has since decreased to a four. The healthcare provider recommended an MRI scan of the affected shoulder. Following the MRI, the patient was referred to physical therapy with a suggested duration of six to eight weeks. The patient was advised to continue taking Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management.

[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection

Vision changes in the right eye.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of high blood pressure.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Reports right eye vision changes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Eyes
- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage
Examination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.

RESULTS

OTC:
Drusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.

Fluorescein angiography:
Reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Wet macular degeneration.
- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I have trouble adjusting in the dark dim environment. when I look at straight lines in your door frame it looks things have been looking a little crooked to me. straight lines they always look wavy to me. there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss. as long as you think it won't hurt a lot that will be good. | O: drusen in the macula, retinal thickening, presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation, and it is positive for a hemorrhage for your left eye. choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test. focal area of the leakage in the eye is consistent with neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. | A: history of high blood pressure. smoking about a pack a day. neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration. injections of lucent... once a month. important to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed. cut back or quit smoking altogether. | P: patients report no pain at all for the actual injection.","The patient expresses difficulty adapting to dim environments and perceives straight lines as appearing crooked or wavy.

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joe Reed is a pleasant 42-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The patient sustained this injury when he was skiing with some friends. He states the front end of his skis dug into the snow and he ended up doing a cartwheel through the air until he stopped halfway and felt a pop with immediate pain in his right knee. The patient reports pain and swelling in his right knee since the injury. He has been able to ambulate although he notes difficulty due to swelling and pain. The patient has been taking Advil as well as icing and applying heat to his knee intermittently. He denies any previous knee injuries.

The patient also reports right shoulder pain and bruising. He states he landed on his right shoulder when he fell. He reports tenderness with raising his arm.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Right knee pain and swelling. Right shoulder pain and bruising.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 110/74 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 64 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 98%

Examination of the right shoulder: Mild bruising is present.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and are reviewed today. No fracture is appreciated. No bony abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee contusion.
2. Right shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have advised him to rest his right knee and apply ice 2 to 3 times per day for 20 minutes at a time. He can take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. If his pain does not improve with the medication, he will return to the office and we will consider formal physical therapy.

With regards to his right shoulder, I have recommended that we obtain x-rays of the right shoulder as well.

[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay

INSTRUCTIONS

Patient will return for follow-up in 2 weeks.",S: i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend i would take them for mile long walks everyday... i could only walk down to the end of the street i've been having a dry cough no phlegm every time i swallow it hurts... in my chest some crackles in your lungs bilaterally... could mean you have some fluid in there vitals are normal your pulse ox is everything's good | O: some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest... due to that radiation burn chest x-ray... shows evidence of mild radiation umitis [pneumonitis] radiation pneumonitis... creeping up to your esophagus causing the pain | A: the tumor has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out | P: continue you on that chemo regimen... cisplatin and a topicide [etoposide] prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams... for five days prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow... four times a day no fever... no body aches... no sinus pain zofran helped with nausea and fatigue follow-up in two weeks,"The patient has reported experiencing some shortness of breath over the weekend, which was previously manageable with mile-long walks. However, they are now only able to walk to the end of the street. The patient also mentions having a dry cough without producing phlegm. Each time they swallow, they experience chest pain and notice crackles in their lungs bilaterally. These symptoms could potentially indicate the presence of fluid in the lungs. Despite these concerns, the patient's vitals, including pulse and oxygen saturation levels, remain normal.","The patient presented with some redness on the chest area, specifically on the anterior aspect. This erythema was a result of radiation therapy, as indicated by the chest x-ray. The x-ray also showed signs of mild radiation pneumonitis, or radiation-induced inflammation of the lungs. The condition was progressing towards the esophagus, causing discomfort and pain.","The medical team has observed a reduction in the size of the tumor. Based on this observation, they have determined that the tumor is now suitable for surgical removal. The clinical reasoning behind this decision is that the shrinkage of the tumor indicates a response to current treatment, which increases the likelihood of successful surgery with minimal complications. However, it is important to note that further evaluations and tests will be necessary to confirm the tumor's suitability for removal and to develop an appropriate surgical plan.","The patient will be continued on their current chemotherapy regimen, which includes cisplatin and etoposide (topotecan). A low-dose steroid, prednisone, will be prescribed at 40 milligrams per day for a duration of five days. Additionally, the patient will be given a lidocaine solution for swallowing, to be taken four times a day. It is important that the patient does not develop a fever, body aches, or sinus pain during this time. Zofran will be prescribed to help manage nausea and fatigue. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks.","S: The patient has reported experiencing some shortness of breath over the weekend, which was previously manageable with mile-long walks. However, they are now only able to walk to the end of the street. The patient also mentions having a dry cough without producing phlegm. Each time they swallow, they experience chest pain and notice crackles in their lungs bilaterally. These symptoms could potentially indicate the presence of fluid in the lungs. Despite these concerns, the patient's vitals, including pulse and oxygen saturation levels, remain normal.
O: The patient presented with some redness on the chest area, specifically on the anterior aspect. This erythema was a result of radiation therapy, as indicated by the chest x-ray. The x-ray also showed signs of mild radiation pneumonitis, or radiation-induced inflammation of the lungs. The condition was progressing towards the esophagus, causing discomfort and pain.
A: The medical team has observed a reduction in the size of the tumor. Based on this observation, they have determined that the tumor is now suitable for surgical removal. The clinical reasoning behind this decision is that the shrinkage of the tumor indicates a response to current treatment, which increases the likelihood of successful surgery with minimal complications.

[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten
[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten
[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad
[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away

[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past
[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they
[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of

[patient] no no no pain
[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible

[patient] perfect thank you
[doctor] alright great","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right flank pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joshua Reyes is a pleasant 18-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right flank pain.

For the last 2 weeks, the patient has been experiencing pain that starts in his right flank and radiates down into his groin. He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.

VITALS

Blood pressure: Slightly elevated

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.
MSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.

RESULTS

CT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S: it comes and goes... depends on how much I've been drinking and activities had them before... passed some by myself and had surgery a couple times | O: pain starts up in the flank and radiates down to my groin no blood... episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles pain score... 4 out of ten when it gets a little more out of control... 1 or 2 out of ten | A: family has had kidney stones in the past CT scan... 0.5 cm in proximal ureter, no hydronephrosis follow up in one to two weeks if still having symptoms continue to push fluids and hopefully pass the stone urinalysis and urine culture to rule out infection consider lithotripsy if stone not passed by follow-up | P: taking ibuprofen... persists prescribe tramadol 50 mg for breakthrough pain","The patient experiences intermittent symptoms, which seem to be exacerbated by alcohol consumption and physical activities. Previously, they have managed to pass some of these symptoms on their own. However, they have undergone surgery a few times due to these issues.","The individual experienced a pain episode starting in their flank and radiating down to their groin. No bleeding was reported during this incident. During a particularly severe episode, the pain extended to one of their testicles.

Currently, there is a small kidney stone, approximately 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal ureter as indicated by a CT scan. No signs of hydronephrosis were observed. The patient is advised to continue pushing fluids to aid in passing the stone. If symptoms persist beyond the next one to two weeks, further evaluation and potential intervention may be necessary. A urinalysis and urine culture are recommended to rule out the possibility of a urinary tract infection. If the stone has not passed by the follow-up appointment, lithotripsy may be considered as a treatment option.","The patient is currently taking ibuprofen for pain management.

Shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of coronary disease, acute myocardial infarction in 2018, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and knee pain. He denies a history of gout.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports placement of a coronary artery stent in the right coronary artery in 2018.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he is a fan of basketball.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Lasix 40 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath.
Genitourinary: Denies changes in urination.
Musculoskeletal: Reports swelling in bilateral lower extremities and great toe pain.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 135/80 mmHg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Jugular venous distention up to approximately 9 cm. There are no carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.

2. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.

3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.
- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.

4. Possible gout flare.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.
- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Andrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.

The patient reports that he has been doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so. He started to feel really tired and short of breath. The patient denies coughing up anything, but he feels like he will soon be coughing up phlegm. He denies having a fever, but he felt a little warm. He attributed this to exerting himself. He reports that his elbows hurt quite a bit. He notes his knees were pretty tired and he felt some tension around his knees. The patient attributes these symptoms to lifting heavy bags. He has not been wearing a mask as much recently. He believes that he caught his first cold and his symptoms have worsened. He has had both of his COVID vaccinations.

He denies any history of seasonal allergies.

Regarding his depression, he states it has been a crazy year and a half. He was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, he has been doing well with it. His wife got him into barre classes and this has been relaxing.

Regarding his diabetes, he has been monitoring his sugar levels while he is at work, but is not as consistent on Saturdays and Sundays. His diet has been pretty good for the most part, except for some house parties. They have not been elevated since his respiratory symptoms began.

The patient has been monitoring his blood pressure at home. He reports that he is very regular with monitoring his blood pressure during the week, though less consistently on weekends. He reports his blood pressure has been under control. He has continued to utilize lisinopril 20 mg, daily.

The patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.

Upper respiratory infection.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe he has contracted a viral syndrome. His chest x-ray was unremarkable and he has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.
• Additional Testing: We will obtain a COVID-19 test to rule this out.
• Medical Treatment: I recommend he use Robitussin for cough, as well as ibuprofen or Tylenol if he develops a fever.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been practicing barre classes and is doing well overall.
• Medical Treatment: I offered medication or psychotherapy, but the patient opted to defer at this time.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: His blood glucose levels have been well controlled based on home monitoring, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.
• Additional Testing: We will repeat a hemoglobin A1c in 4 months.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with lisinopril and his blood pressures have been well controlled based on home monitoring.
• Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel.
• Medical Treatment: He will continue on lisinopril 20 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Follow up: I would like to see him back in approximately 4 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I started to feel really tired, was short of breath. we're not wearing masks as much at the end of the summer and I caught my first cold and it just got worse.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrea Roberts is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux, who presents today for her annual exam. It has been a year since she was last seen.

Rheumatoid arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient has remained active and has been compliant with methotrexate once weekly. Her recent autoimmune panel was normal.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue on methotrexate 2.5 mg once weekly. This was refilled today.
• Specialist Referrals: If she needs a referral back to the rheumatologist, she will let me know.

Atrial fibrillation.
• Medical Reasoning: She continues to experience episodes of palpitations. Her most recent episode was about 1 week ago. She is in normal sinus rhythm today, but her recent cardiac event monitor demonstrated a conversion pause.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to cardiology for a cardiac ablation.

GERD.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications and denies any episodes in approximately 5 months.
• Medical Treatment: Continue on Protonix 40 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She could continue with dietary modifications and avoid known dietary triggers.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I've been walking you told me to and exercising and doing yoga, [...] that's helped with my arthritis a lot [...] I haven't had any joint pain recently.

They have also eliminated soda from their diet and continue to take medication, which have seemed to help. The patient has not experienced a flare-up of their symptoms in over five months.","During the physical examination, the healthcare provider noted a faint, systolic murmur of 2/6 intensity in the heart. The lungs were clear, but the patient displayed signs of edema and some erythema. There was pain upon palpation of the elbow. The provider recommended continuing the methotrexate treatment, with a dosage of 2.5mg administered once weekly. The protonix dose was to remain at 40mg daily. The patient reported no symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. However, they mentioned experiencing nasal congestion due to allergies.","Andrea Roberts, a 52-year-old female patient, attended her annual examination today. During the visit, the healthcare provider conducted a thorough assessment of her health status. Based on the information gathered through the examination and medical history, the provider identified several key findings:

1. Vital signs: Andrea's blood pressure was within the normal range, while her weight and body mass index (BMI) indicated she was overweight. Her heart rate and respiratory rate were also within normal limits.

2. Physical examination: The provider noted some mild signs of joint inflammation in Andrea's hands, particularly in the knuckles. There were no signs of rashes or other skin abnormalities. Her abdominal exam was unremarkable, but mild tenderness was noted in her lower back.

3. Medical history: Andrea reported experiencing occasional joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the mornings. She also mentioned having occasional heartburn and bloating after meals. She denied any recent injuries or trauma. Her family history was significant for several cases of arthritis and type 2 diabetes.

4. Clinical reasoning: Based on Andrea's symptoms, physical findings, and family history","The patient is experiencing irregular heart rhythms, specifically in and out of atrial fibrillation, with a conversion pause.

Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.

Regarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.

Regarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out. He thinks he would probably want to continue that at least for a couple more months and see how it goes. His wife got him into meditation recently and he finds that relaxing so he feels he would like to continue that for a couple more months and see how it goes.

The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Albert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.

Hyperglycemia.
• Medical Reasoning: He was recently seen in the emergency department with elevated blood glucose levels. He admits to dietary indiscretion prior to this, but has since improved his diet. His recent blood glucose level was 162, and his recent hemoglobin A1c was 8.
• Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in a few months.
• Medical Treatment: Increase Lantus to 20 units at night.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue monitoring his blood glucose levels at home and report those to me, as we may need to make further adjustments to his medication.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He reports personal stressors over the past year and a half but is doing well overall. He recently started meditating.
• Medical Treatment: He should continue his current management strategies. We will hold off on medication and therapy at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: The patient was encouraged to contact me if he needs anything.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: His kidney function appears stable and he has been compliant with his immunotherapy medications.
• Medical Treatment: Continue seeing Dr. Reyes for management of his immunosuppression medication.
• Patient Education and Counseling: He knows to reach out to me if he needs anything.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Albert is a 62-year-old male, with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant, who is here today for emergency room follow-up. | O: Increase your Lantus to 20 units at night.

Right arm pain.

HPI:

Ms. Martinez is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right arm pain after she hitting her arm on a pole while playing tennis. She had mild swelling at the time. There is pain with motion. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hand. She has a past medical history of allergies and takes Flonase.

EXAM

Examination of the left wrist shows tenderness over the distal radius and pain with flexion of the wrist and thumb.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left wrist show no obvious signs of acute fracture or other abnormality.

IMPRESSION

Right wrist sprain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and anti-inflammatory medications. I am prescribing Motrin, 800 mg to take 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me in 1 week or as needed.","S: I was playing tennis... hit the top of the net but the pole part. And, and it just jarred my arm. It did. It got a little bit of swelling. Not a lot. I had a trauma of a stabbing of...

The first incident occurred while playing tennis, where they hit the top of the net pole, resulting in a jarring sensation. Following this incident, they noticed some swelling in the affected area. The second incident happened during lawn work, where they fell while using a rake. Despite these incidents, no fractures or abnormalities were observed. The patient is currently experiencing pain in the arm following the tennis incident. Based on the assessment, the patient is diagnosed with a strain and possible contusion in the affected muscle. If the symptoms do not improve within a week, the patient is advised to seek further evaluation.",The patient presented with tenderness localized over the distal radius during the physical examination.,"The patient expressed discomfort in their arm, specifically in the area leading up to the wrist. They reported minor pain during wrist movement and no numbness in their hand. The patient mentioned having allergies and using Flonase for treatment. Additionally, they described experiencing pain in their thumb during times of stress and while flexing it. The patient is currently taking an anti-inflammatory medication, Motrin, with a dosage of 800 milligrams taken three times a day with food.

Clinical Reasoning: Based on the patient's description of localized arm pain, wrist discomfort, and thumb pain during stress or flexion, it is possible that the patient is experiencing conditions such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis, arthritis, or a wrist strain. The presence of allergies and use of Flonase could potentially be contributing factors, but further assessment is required to rule out other possible causes. The reported relief of symptoms with the use of an anti-inflammatory medication, Motrin, suggests that inflammation may be a contributing factor. A thorough physical examination, including range of motion assessment and special tests, would be necessary to reach a definit","The patient will be administered ice therapy to help alleviate pain and reduce swelling. This can be done by applying an ice pack to the affected area for short periods of time, ideally 15-20 minutes at a time, with breaks in between to prevent potential tissue damage. This treatment is usually repeated several times a day to maximize its benefits. It is important for the patient to follow up with their healthcare provider if the pain and swelling persist despite the use of ice therapy or worsen over time.","S: The patient reported two incidents that caused discomfort in their arm.

Clinical Reasoning: Based on the patient's description of localized arm pain, wrist discomfort, and thumb pain during stress or flexion, it is possible that the patient is experiencing conditions such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis, arthritis, or a wrist strain. The presence of allergies and use of Flonase could potentially be contributing factors, but further assessment is required to rule out other possible causes. The reported relief of symptoms with the use of an anti-inflammatory medication, Motrin, suggests that inflammation may be a contributing factor. A thorough physical examination, including range of motion assessment and special tests, would be necessary to reach a definit
P: The patient will be administered ice therapy to help alleviate pain and reduce swelling. This can be done by applying an ice pack to the affected area for short periods of time, ideally 15-20 minutes at a time, with breaks in between to prevent potential tissue damage. This treatment is usually repeated several times a day to maximize its benefits. It is important for the patient to follow up with their healthcare provider if the pain and swelling persist despite the use of ice therapy or worsen over time."

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.

The patient states he has had some shortness of breath and mild leg swelling which he thinks has to do with eating some salty foods at some house parties recently. His shortness of breath is primarily with exertion such as walking up the stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days now. He woke from sleep once with shortness of breath about a week ago. He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.

Regarding his type 1 diabetes, he is using his insulin pump. He has been consistently monitoring his blood sugars during the working week, but notes that he checks less on the weekends, due to being busy. He is trying to avoid sugar but admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.

Regarding his depression, he states that it has been a crazy year and a half. He has tried some natural solutions. In the summer, he did daily outdoor stretching, which was great; but now that the weather has changed, he needs to find some alternatives. He is not ready to try any medications. He denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.

Regarding his GERD, he is taking his omeprazole. He has made some lifestyle modifications like cutting back on his red bull intake and other caffeine. Reducing his alcohol intake has been tough during the holiday season, but he is getting better about this.

The patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, and abdominal pain.

ASSESSMENT

Lawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.

PLAN

Acute heart failure exacerbation.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid. He has noticed increased fluid retention following dietary indiscretion. He has experienced dyspnea on exertion for the past 10 days.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Lasix 40 mg a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and log his daily weights. He will contact me if these continue to increase. He was instructed to call me or 911 if he experiences dyspnea at rest.

Type 1 diabetes.
• Medical Treatment: This is currently stable with use of an insulin pump.
• Additional Testing: I will order a hemoglobin A1c in 1 month.
• Medical Treatment: He will continue the insulin pump. The patient will follow up with his endocrinologist.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to have an eye exam.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient has been doing well with outdoor stretching. He continues to decline the use of medications for this issue.
• Medical Treatment: I will refer him to psychiatry as his current management strategy is unsustainable due to the change in season.
• Patient Education and Counseling: We will defer initiating medication at this time.

Acid reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: His symptoms are stable with medication.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 20 mg a day.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.

Back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Cheryl is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain. On physical examination, everything looks good. On your back exam, you do have some pain to palpation on the lateral aspect of your lumbar spine, and you do have pain with flexion and extension, and you have a negative straight leg raise. Back x-ray reveals good boney alignment. There’s no obvious fracture. Regarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril. | O: I’ve been walking a lot lately. I’ve been walking 30 minutes to an hour or a day. And all of a sudden, when I was walking, my back just seized up on me. I’ve been taking ibuprofen, and I’ve been putting some heat on it. But it’s still pretty stiff. I have been lifting more, probably around three times a week. I don’t know if it was because I was doing deadlifts that day and walked. No, I haven’t felt anything that [numbness/tingling]. No weakness in my lower extremities. Your labs… all look great. There’s no elevated white blood cell count. There’s no signs of infection. I want to prescribe meloxicam, 15 milligrams once a day. I want you to ice the area, and you can also apply heat sometimes. I’m going to refer you to physical therapy just to do some strengthening exercises of your back. You’re doing a really good job with [blood pressure]. I want you to continue on the lisinopril, 10 milligrams a day. | A: The patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies. The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. | P: It was about six days ago. It was the lower back. Both equally.","Cheryl, a 34-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, presents to the clinic today complaining of back pain. During the physical examination, the healthcare provider notes tenderness on palpation of the lateral aspect of Cheryl's lumbar spine and pain with both flexion and extension movements.

Regarding her hypertension, Cheryl reports that her home readings have been improving, and she has been making dietary modifications. She is currently taking lisinopril as medication.","The patient, who has been walking extensively each day, experienced a sudden onset of back pain during one of their walks. They have been managing the pain with ibuprofen and heat therapy. The patient denies any numbness, tingling, or weakness in their lower extremities. Their recent lab results indicate no signs of infection or elevated white blood cell count. The healthcare provider recommends meloxicam, 15 milligrams once daily for pain management. The patient is advised to ice the affected area and apply heat occasionally. A referral to physical therapy is made to address back strengthening exercises. The patient's blood pressure management remains commendable, and they should continue taking lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily.","The patient presents with complaints of nasal congestion, an symptom she associates with her seasonal allergies. She acknowledges and consents to the proposed medical intervention.","Six days ago, the patient experienced lower back pain that affected both sides equally. The treatment plan included the following:

1. Pain medication: The patient was prescribed over-the-counter pain medication to help manage the discomfort.
2. Rest and ice: The patient was advised to rest and apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.
3. Physical therapy: The patient was referred to a physical therapist for exercises and techniques to improve flexibility, strength, and range of motion in the lower back.
4. Posture correction: The patient was advised to practice good posture to reduce strain on the lower back muscles.
5. Follow-up appointment: The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with their healthcare provider to assess their progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

The patient was instructed to report any worsening of symptoms or new symptoms to their healthcare provider promptly. They were also encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques, to promote healing and prevent future episodes of lower back pain.","S: Cheryl, a 34-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, presents to the clinic today complaining of back pain.

[patient] uh- .
[doctor] . a little bit .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .

Left shoulder pain.

HPI:

Ms. Anderson is a 44-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of the left shoulder. She states that she was in gymnastics 1 week ago. The pain has been present since that time. She has pain with any type of movement of her left shoulder. She had taken Tylenol for 2 to 3 days with no improvement in her symptoms.

She has a surgical history significant for prior left upper extremity surgery.

EXAM

Examination of the left shoulder shows pain with range of motion.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder, 3 views obtained on today's visit show no obvious signs of fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.","S: I'm having this left shoulder pain lately, and it's paining a lot. I was in gymnastics class...

Continue using the pain reliever, maybe just 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week. If it's still painful, you can use ice or heat pad... might help relieve your pain. Come back to see me if the pain still there after maybe three weeks... may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time. | P: It's been a week, doctor. You can also try Advil... Aleve.","The patient has been experiencing significant pain in their left shoulder recently. The pain began after an incident in a gymnastics class, during which they may have assumed an unusual position. Despite taking Tylenol for a few days, the pain has not improved. It is worth noting that the patient has undergone past surgery on their left arm, but they believe this is unrelated to their current symptoms.","The patient experiences pain during any movement of the left shoulder.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Elizabeth Peterson is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history significant for depression and hypertension. She presents today for her annual exam.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with weekly therapy. She also has a solid support system at home.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled based on daily home monitoring. She has been compliant with lisinopril.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue with daily home monitoring of her blood pressures. She will contact me via the patient portal for any elevation in these readings.

Healthcare maintenance.
• Medical Reasoning: She is due for her annual mammogram.
• Additional Testing: We will order a mammogram for her.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: you were talking about some nasal congestion | O: I've been going to therapy once a week for the past year, mostly virtually, but starting to get in-person.

[patient] sure . so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while , about five months or so . hurts all the time . pretty bad at times .
[doctor] mm . that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ?
[patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .
[doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ?
[patient] well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .
[doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine .
[patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .
[doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?
[patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .
[doctor] yeah , okay . how about any numbness or tingling ? have you felt that at any point ?
[patient] no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .
[doctor] understood . understood . all right . well , let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] okay . use my general physical exam template . mr . james , i'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from . just let me know when it hurts .
[patient] okay . it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder .
[doctor] okay . left shoulder and elbow , tender sa space , no warmth , erythema or deformity . positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test . normal proximal and distar , distal upper extremity strength . intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees . normal empty tan , can test . okay , mr . james , w-what i think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder . i do n't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist , but because everything is connected , you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder . we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall , so it's good you came to see us , you came in to see us so we could help .

Left shoulder and elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Jose James is a 64-year-old male who presents for left shoulder and elbow pain.

The patient reports falling on his hand while going up stairs 5 months ago and has been experiencing constant pain since. He admits he was continuing to complete strength training exercises at least 2 times per week, however, he was unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds due to the pain.

During the past 1-2 weeks, Mr. James has discontinued strength training activities. Additionally, he has iced the inflicted areas, denies taking any pain medications, and reports his pain has slightly improved but it is still rather constant. He denies tingling and numbness.

The patient walks 30-minutes most days of the week.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Retired last year, was an office worker.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Left shoulder and elbow, tender subacromial space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer’s test. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation. Abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty can test.

ASSESSMENT

• Impingement syndrome of left shoulder

Jose is a 64-year-old male who was seen today for impingement syndrome of his left shoulder, likely related to a fall he incurred 5 months ago.

PLAN

Today I discussed conservative options for left shoulder impingement with the patient, who opted to try physical therapy 2 session per week. Cortisone injection was discussed as an option if the physical therapy does not successfully reduce his pain. Additionally, I recommended continued ice and rest.

INSTRUCTIONS

email, or call if symptoms worsen or do not resolve.","S: I've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while, about five months or. Hurts all the time. Pretty bad at times. I fell five months ago going up a stairs, and the pain has been present since. The pain is worse when I lift, and I haven't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating. Over the past one to two weeks, I've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just wasn't worth it honestly. I have iced a bit, but I have not taken anything for the pain. My wife and I walk about 30 minutes almost every day. We have done this since I retired from my office job last year. You are dealing with impingement syndrome of your left shoulder. I don't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist, but because everything is connected, you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder. | O: First option would be to start with physical therapy. I would recommend two sessions per week as any other exercises they give you to do at home. We can start there and if that doesn't improve your pain, we could try a cortisone injection. I the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it doesn’t help. I am not opposed to a shot but would try the therapy first. | A: Left shoulder and elbow, tender subacromial space, no warmth, erythema or deformity. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer’s test. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty can test. | P: No tingling or numbless, numbness, thankfully. Please continue to ice, especially your shoulder, and rest as much as you can.","The patient has been experiencing persistent pain in their left shoulder and elbow for approximately five months following a fall on the stairs. The pain is constant and at times severe, worsening during lifting activities. The patient's ability to lift weights has been limited to 15-20 pounds due to the pain. Recently, they have stopped attending the gym due to the discomfort. The patient and their spouse engage in regular 30-minute walks daily. The patient is suspected to have impingement syndrome in their left shoulder based on their reported symptoms. There is no indication of an additional injury or issue in the wrist, but the pain in the wrist may be related to the shoulder condition.","The healthcare professional suggested initiating physical therapy as the first course of action for managing the patient's pain. They recommended attending two sessions per week and performing additional exercises at home. If the physical therapy did not bring about significant improvement, the healthcare professional was open to the possibility of administering a cortisone injection as the next step. The healthcare professional expressed a preference for starting with physical therapy but was willing to consider the injection if necessary.","The patient presented with tenderness in the left subacromial space, specifically in the shoulder and elbow area. There were no signs of warmth, erythema, or deformity observed. The Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's tests were positive, indicating a potential diagnosis of a subacromial impingement or rotator cuff injury. However, the proximal and distal upper extremity strength was found to be normal, as were the median, radial, and ulnar sensations. The empty can test was also normal, indicating no signs of nerve compression or neuropathy. Based on these findings, the clinical reasoning suggests a possible diagnosis of a subacromial impingement or rotator cuff injury, with normal neuromuscular function. Further diagnostic tests, such as an ultrasound or MRI, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the injury. Treatment options may include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, or corticosteroid injections.","The individual is advised to continue icing, particularly their shoulder, and take ample rest with no reported instances of tingling or numbness.","S: The patient has been experiencing persistent pain in their left shoulder and elbow for approximately five months following a fall on the stairs.

"[doctor] next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8/10/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write . physical exam , auto text uri .
[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ?
[patient_guest] we're okay , thank you .
[doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?
[patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .
[doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ?
[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Randy Gutierrez is a 9-month-old male who is being evaluated today for a cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. He is accompanied by his mother.

Symptoms began yesterday around dinnertime with clear nasal drainage, pulling on his ears bilaterally, and rubbing his nose frequently. He does not have a barky cough or a sore throat. His rectal temperature was 100.3 degrees. The patient did consume a 7 ounce bottle this morning, but mostly denied the next offered bottle and declined cereal. He is irritable and having trouble falling asleep, described “like he is fighting it”.

The patient has been exposed to an older sister who is sick and a cousin who has a sinus infection.

Treatment has included saline nasal spray, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier. When the patient aroused this morning, he was warm to the touch. When his sleeper was removed, he was quite sweaty despite the air conditioner being on.

The patient's dandruff is also worsening. The only tried treatment is Aveeno shampoo.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat
Nasal congestion, clear mucus, rhinorrhea. Bilateral pulling of ears, no sore throat or hoarseness.

Respiratory

ASSESSMENT

• Viral infection
• Dandruff

PLAN

Viral infection
The patient presents with a viral infection and does not need antibiotics currently. I advised continuation of fluids, rest. Additionally, I suggested trying Zarbee’s for children under 1 years old. If a croup cough develops, the patient will receive a 0.5 teaspoon.

I also provided counseling to the mother to avoid giving honey to the patient for his first year of life due to botulism spores.

Dandruff
The patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of dandruff. I recommended Head and Shoulders shampoo, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral A-D 2 times per week, combined with his usual shampoo. I counseled the mother that she should be careful not to get the shampoo in the patient eyes and to not use the extra strength shampoos. Additionally, he may also use baby oil and a soft brush on the area.

New acne evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female who presents for new patient evaluation of acne located on the face. She is accompanied by her mother today.

Kayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient’s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.

The patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Lives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.

FAMILY HISTORY

No significant family medical history.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Full exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Comedonal acne.
• Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

PLAN

Comedonal acne.
We discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.

Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.
Reassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.

"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .

ASSESSMENT

• Macromastia.

Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.

PLAN

An extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.

Risks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.

The patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.

Return to clinic prior to scheduled surgery date for preoperative counseling and consent.","S: They [breasts] are always sweaty underneath.

[patient] yes , ma'am .
[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?
[patient] that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .
[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .
[patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?
[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
[patient] what's oxalate ?
[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .
[patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .
[doctor] perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .

ASSESSMENT

• Hematuria.
• Chronic urolithiasis.

Mrs. Wood presents today for renal ultrasound. The patient has had recurrent episodes of hematuria over the past few months secondary to chronic urolithiasis. Mrs. Wood reports passing two small stone like structures last week. Urinalysis today was notable for only a trace amount of blood and the renal ultrasound revealed a 6 mm non-obstructing renal stone in the left kidney.

PLAN

No surgical intervention is recommended, and the patient would like to discuss urolithiasis prevention. We had a very lengthy discussion with regards to urolithiasis formation and treating the underlying cause to prevent reoccurrence and associated potential dietary factors that could be involved with urolithiasis formation.

It is recommended that the patient maintain a healthy diet; limit salt, and animal protein. she should increase fluid consumption; adequate intake is half of her body weight in ounces of water daily and avoid sugary drinks. A copy of the dietary recommendations and avoidances was provided to the patient for reference. We will continue to monitor annually with renal ultrasound unless new symptoms develop. The patient voiced understanding and agreed with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

For the past six weeks, I've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of cherry Kool-Aid. Last week, I was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible.

Status post mitral valve repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Melissa Sanchez is a 58-year-old female being seen today for a status post mitral valve repair, completed on 08/03/2020.

On 09/17/20 we saw Mrs. Sanchez in office, and she was doing well and thus we recommended maintaining her current medications, she is using a reminder app to stay compliant with medications.

The patient reports feeling better and overall, pretty good. She denies experiencing new symptoms. She is still having chest pain intermittently, and her breathing “gets shallow” which results in her “slowing down” and decreasing her exertion. An episode of shortness of breath and chest pains may last a few minutes and will not recur for a few weeks.

Psoriatic arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Judy Gomez is a 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis.

Ms. Gomez is currently taking methotrexate and prednisone 1 mg daily. She believes methotrexate has been relieving her joint pain.

The patient reports she has been doing well since her last visit. She has been able to decrease her prednisone dose to 1 mg daily; however, she took 2 mg for a couple of days due to increased pain in her bilateral feet.

The patient states when she received her first COVID-19 vaccine she held her methotrexate and felt ""horrible"" all week until the next Wednesday when she took it. She felt better by the end of the week. She did not hold methotrexate for her second COVID-19 vaccine.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal: Full range of motion. Dystrophy of all the nails of the toes.

ASSESSMENT

• Psoriatic arthritis.
• High risk medication use.

PLAN

Psoriatic arthritis.

[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .

[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .
[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .

Heart murmur.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.

Ms. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a “new, worrisome” heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling “overly tired” but attributes this to her polypharmacy.

The patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hyperlipidemia.
Hypertension.
Hypothyroid.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Requires a walker to ambulate.

FAMILY HISTORY

Son had a myocardial infarction.
Brother had a stroke and has diabetes.
Older sister has an unknown heart problem.
Family is positive for heart disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Levothyroxine.
Lisinopril.
Simvastatin 20 mg.
Meclizine.
Amlodipine.

ALLERGIES

No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly, no acute distress.

Cardiovascular
Normal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.

Musculoskeletal
Lower extremity edema

Neurologic
Gait normal for age.

RESULTS

EKG
Impression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.

ASSESSMENT

• Cardiac murmur.
• PVCs.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Hypothyroid.
• Lightheadedness/dizziness.

PLAN

Cardiac murmur
Diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.

PVCs
Her referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.

Hypertension
She is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.

Hyperlipidemia
This is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.

Hypothyroidism
She takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.

Lightheadedness/dizziness
She is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.","S: I'm 100, we can't really get around that one. My doctor says that I have a heart murmur. I get short of breath if I walk too fast or too long, or if I tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. I started taking pain pills for my legs. My ankles swell... I lost a little bit of weight, but I still weigh a 120 pounds, but I normally weigh about 130 pounds. I feel overly tired because I take all that medication. It was my son, not my brother. Compared to six months ago or a year ago? I would say probably 70 to 80% from about six months ago. I do take a pill for that when it does get bad... only when I do feel dizzy. | O: 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or we just call it TAVR. Statin could be indicated... possibly to stop your statin. | P: I do have a walker, I don’t know. Maybe when I walk to the end of the driveway or I walk around the culdesac. Because of your age and medical history, that wouldn’t be a good option for you. We will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps. We don’t have to make any decisions today... wanted to go over a couple of these things.","The patient, who is 100 years old, reports experiencing shortness of breath when walking too fast or too long, or upon consuming a large amount of water at once.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the statement, as the provider suggests stopping the statin, which is typically used to reduce cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular diseases. It is essential to clarify this point with the healthcare provider to ensure proper medication management.","The healthcare professional acknowledged the patient's use of a walker for short distances, but advised against this option due to their age and medical history.

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Charles Sullivan is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of shortness of breath. The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets “mid-shortness of breath” without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.

He enjoys hunting.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: Normal on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.
HEAD: No angioedema.
RESPIRATORY: No audible stridor. I do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields.
SKIN: No rash.

RESULTS

A chest x-ray, obtained and reviewed today is normal.
Pulmonary function test, obtained and reviewed today is normal.

ASSESSMENT

Newly diagnosed allergic asthma.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.","S: I seem to catch my breath a lot more than I used to. moved out in the city [about two years ago] bought this big plot of land.

"[doctor] so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on
[patient] i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot
[doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before
[patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day
[doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing
[patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help
[doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing
[patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit
[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity
[doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt
[patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes
[doctor] okay how about when you stand back up
[patient] no pain
[doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that
[patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts
[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship
[patient] partners
[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am
[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury
[patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't
[doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back
[patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him
[doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands
[patient] can you repeat that
[doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back
[patient] i
[doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg
[patient] that would be my right leg
[doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before
[patient] i have not taken meloxicam
[doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan
[patient] it sounds reasonable
[doctor] alright
[patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it
[doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving
[patient] good answer
[doctor] alright alright hope you feel better","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Low back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bryan Brooks is a pleasant 39-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. He is accompanied today by his partner.

Approximately 2 hours after he finished raking leaves yesterday, the patient began to feel a tightening sensation in his low back and tingling in his right foot. Prior to this, he recalls a similar episode approximately 3 years ago in which his symptoms resolved after 1 day. Ice and Advil provided no relief, but his pain is less severe when he is in a seated position and taking a hot shower helped alleviate his pain. The patient's partner reports that his pain seems to worsen when he stands up.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.
Neurological: Reports tingling in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain on extension. Some pain with flexion. Pain with palpation around L5. Dorsiflexion is normal. Pulses are equal in all extremities.

RESULTS

X-rays obtained and reviewed in office today were normal.

ASSESSMENT

Low back sprain.

PLAN

The examination findings and x-ray results were discussed with the patient and his partner today. I recommend we treat this conservatively with rest, meloxicam, and formal physical therapy. If he fails to improve, we can consider obtaining an MRI for further evaluation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S: Bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on I was in my yard yesterday and I was raking leaves and I felt fine and when I got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and I started getting pins and needles in my foot I had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day Put some ice on it and I tried two Advils and it didn't help The only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when I sit Does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing?

[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you

[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had that before
[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
[doctor] okay do you
[patient] i'm not really sure how
[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
[patient] i think they told me it was around ten
[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Hernandez is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. Onset of ulcer was approximately 2 months ago after walking barefoot on the beach. He reports the ulcer has recently become red and is draining. At times he will also experience throbbing pain. He has seen his primary care physician and was prescribed antibiotics, however, he has not started them yet and does not recall the name of the medication.

The patient is a diabetic. He is taking medication for this, however, he does not monitor his blood sugar consistently. His last A1C was around 10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with redness and drainage.

VITALS

Vital signs are normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect laterally just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some redness and drainage present as well as edema. No necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. Nontender to palpation.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine the blood supply in his foot. Debridement will be performed. A prescription for clindamycin 400 mg 2 times per day for 7 days will be provided as he does seem to have an infection. He will also be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support for the next month.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and for possible repeat debridement. He has been advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and we will get him in sooner, however, if he starts to develop a fever or necrosis he has been instructed to go to the ER.",S: nonhealing foot ulcer 1 by 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral foot just proximal to the fifth mtp joint order an abi ankle brachial index prescribe clindamycin 400 mg twice a day for seven days | O: I've had it for about two months I didn't pick them up from the pharmacy yet I take my medication but I don't check my sugar all the time they told me it was around ten some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it I don't see any necrosis you don't have any odor and I don't appreciate any bony exposure sometimes it does feel there is some throbbing going on | A: walking barefoot on the beach no evidence of osteomyelitis get you a shoe see you back in two weeks call the office if anything happens in between go to the urgent care or the er if you feel fever or if you get black or anything | P: it's recently become red and is draining perform a debridement,"The patient is currently experiencing a non-healing foot ulcer with a size of approximately 1 by 2 inches.

[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright do you have any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.

The patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.

Regarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever and chills.
Skin: Reports right foot wound.
Neurological: Reports neuropathy.

VITALS

Temperature: 98.1.
Heart rate: 72.
Respiration: 16.
Blood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.
SKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.
2. Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.

[doctor] that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars
[patient] i think they're little bit better
[doctor] okay what makes you think that have you been taking them
[patient] yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember
[doctor] okay how often are you checking it
[patient] i would say four five times a week

[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how is your diet
[patient] kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better
[doctor] alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like

[doctor] alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt
[patient] little bit
[doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it
[patient] i can i think that's all i can i can bend
[doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight
[patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp
[doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] alright awesome","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

William Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Approximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.

In terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.

His diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 180/80 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
RESPIRATORY:
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.

For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.

For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.","S: I heard a snap and instant pain when I was on the trampoline. That's the first time I'd ever done something like that. I tried to elevate it and that was about it. The Tylenol didn't really help. My blood pressure is 180 over 80. I don't monitor my blood pressures at home. I check my blood sugars 4 to 5 times a week.

Additionally, the healthcare professional suggests ordering an A1C and lipid panel for managing the patient's diabetes. An A1C test measures the average level of blood sugar over the past two to three months, providing valuable information about the patient's diabetes control. A lipid panel, on the other hand, measures various types of lipids (fats) in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides.

[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[doctor] that's okay
[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[doctor] absolutely
[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here

Matthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an ""electrical tooth ache"" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.

ASSESSMENT

Acute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.

PLAN

I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a epidural steroid injection into the lumbar spine today. He will follow up with me in 4 weeks to check on his progress.",S: Thirty years ago when I fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they said maybe there was a fracture or something. It’s less bad I didn’t take my medications because I wanted you to see me as I am but it’s six out of ten but when it gets really bad I’d say it’s thirteen out of ten. I’m going to recommend an epidural steroid injection and we’re going to do that today for you if you agree to it. | O: My back has been bothering me for a long time. It’s been really bad for about a month. It’s an electrical toothache and it goes down the whole leg. Sitting in the waiting area for thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse. Standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse. I want you to see PT and I want you to see me again in about a month. I’ve been bedridden I’ve had to use a cane I’ve tried NSAIDs in the past without relief | A: Positive for pain to palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back. 4 out of 5 strength in the left and five out of five on the does look that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities. The MRI shows a disk herniation at the level of L4 L5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement. Acute disk herniation at L4 L5 with that nerve root impingement that’s causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain. Denied any numbness or tingling | P: The only thing that seems to make it better is laying down. done some PT.,"Thirty years ago, the patient fell off a roof and experienced significant discomfort, leading medical professionals to suspect a fracture. However, the patient did not consistently take prescribed medications during this time. Currently, the patient reports their pain as a six out of ten on a scale, but it can escalate to a thirteen out of ten when particularly severe. Today, the healthcare provider plans to administer an epidural steroid injection to help manage the patient's pain if they agree to the procedure.","The patient has been experiencing persistent back pain for an extended period of time, which has worsened significantly over the past month. The pain is described as an ""electrical toothache"" that radiates down the entire leg. Sitting for prolonged periods, as well as standing, walking, coughing, and sneezing, exacerbate the symptoms. The patient has been largely bedridden and has tried using a cane, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without finding relief. The patient requests physical therapy evaluation and requests a follow-up appointment in about a month.","The patient presents with back pain that worsens with flexion and extension, and tenderness to palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Neurological assessment reveals brisk reflexes and intact motor and sensory function in both lower extremities, with the exception of 4 out of 5 strength in the left leg. An MRI confirms a disk herniation at the L4-L5 level, accompanied by nerve root impingement. The diagnosis is an acute disk herniation at L4-L5 causing lower back pain and left leg weakness without numbness or tingling.","The patient has undergone physical therapy (PT) as a means to alleviate their symptoms.

[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise
[doctor] it is
[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[doctor] okay
[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[doctor] okay go ahead sorry
[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri

Headaches.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Julie Jenkins is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of headaches. The patient was referred from her primary care physician. The patient states that she was seen by Dr. White a few years ago and was going to obtain an MRI; however, Dr. White wanted her to see me first and urgently.

The onset of her headaches began when she was a teenager. Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.

The patient enjoys running and wears either New Balance or Asics shoes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.

VITALS

Vitals are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Normal head rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
NEURO: Cranial nerves I through XII are intact distally, including a normal cranial reflex.
MSK: Gait is normal.
Funduscopic exam: Positive for papilledema.

ASSESSMENT

Headaches, concern for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for any other condition that could be contributing to her symptoms. We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations.","S: Headaches... have been getting a lot more frequent and a lot more severe.

Neck pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jack Torres is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago after he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He states that he was hit in the back and experienced whiplash. Following the accident he did not present to the emergency room and he does not recall having any swelling or bruising at the neck. He localizes his pain to the posterior aspect of his neck. His pain level is rated at 7 out of 10. When taking ibuprofen he states his pain improves to 5 out of 10. He finds that neck range of motion exacerbates his pain. Initially after the accident he reports that he experienced a couple of headaches, but he states he has not had any recently. He denies any hearing problems or visual disturbances.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he played football years ago without any neck issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies visual disturbances.
HENT: Denies hearing loss.
Musculoskeletal: Reports neck pain.
Neurological: Denies headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NECK: No swelling noted
MSK: Examination of the cervical spine: Positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck. Shoulders and back are nontender to palpation. Positive pain with flexion, rotation, and lateral bending. Severe pain with extension.

RESULTS

3 views of the cervical spine were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Neck strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture or bony abnormalities. Treatment options were discussed and conservative treatment has been recommended. He will begin taking Motrin 600 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A prescription for Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed was also provided. He was advised to be mindful of how he moves his neck and to be conservative to avoid straining his neck. I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI for further evaluation as the patient did not go to the emergency room following his accident. He will also be referred to either physical rehab or a chiropractor pending his MRI results.",S: on a scale of one to ten how severe is it [patient] i would say it's about a seven it's not a constant pain but whenever i move my head which is a lot i i feel it i've tried some ibuprofen that helped a little bit but not too much... just about five out of ten no i didn't want to do that... no that i know about i had a couple early on... no it just stays on monday i played football years ago but i didn't have any issues with my neck though | O: motrin six hundred milligrams every six to eight hours flexeril ten milligrams every twelve hours as needed | A: i was in a car accident hit in the back and my neck went forward and my head went forward really quick that was about a week ago it's in the back of my neck no hearing any hearing problems visual disturbances i also want to order an mri refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the mri this is commonly referred to as whiplash | P: positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck positive pain with flexion severe positive pain to extension positive pain with rotation positive pain on lateral bending,"The patient reports experiencing neck pain with a severity level of around seven on a scale of ten. The pain is not continuous but aggravated by head movements. Ibuprofen provided some relief, but not complete alleviation. The patient has no known prior neck issues and mentions having played football in the past without experiencing related neck problems.","The patient is prescribed Motrin at a dose of 600 milligrams every six to eight hours and Flexeril at a dose of 10 milligrams every twelve hours, as needed. These medications are taken orally for the management of pain. Motrin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), while Flexeril is a muscle relaxant. The healthcare provider recommends taking Motrin every six to eight hours as needed for pain relief, and Flexeril only as needed for muscle pain and discomfort.","The patient described experiencing a car accident approximately a week ago, during which their neck extended forward forcefully while their head did the same. They reported no hearing or visual disturbances, but expressed the intention of undergoing an MRI scan. Based on the patient's history, it is assumed that they are suffering from whiplash, a common injury resulting from sudden acceleration-deceleration forces on the neck. Once the MRI results are available, the healthcare provider may recommend physical rehabilitation or chiropractic care for the patient's treatment.","The patient undergoes a treatment plan for neck pain, which includes the following:

Upon examination, there is positive pain elicited on palpation of the soft tissues in the neck. This indicates the presence of muscle tension or trigger points.

During flexion, the patient experiences severe positive pain. This means that there is increased pain when the neck is bent forward.

Positive pain is also noted on extension, indicating discomfort when the neck is extended backward.

Furthermore, there is positive pain on rotation, suggesting discomfort when the neck is rotated from side to side.

Lastly, there is positive pain on lateral bending, meaning that the patient experiences pain when the neck is bent sideways.

The treatment plan may include a combination of modalities such as massage, heat or cold therapy, and manual manipulation to address the muscle tension and reduce pain. The patient may also be prescribed exercises to improve neck mobility and strength. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.","S: The patient reports experiencing neck pain with a severity level of around seven on a scale of ten.

[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that
[patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[patient] yeah hey did you see the masters i know you're a golfer
[doctor] yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too
[patient] i did
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah
[patient] but that's it was i i could n't believe tiger went out there of course he did
[doctor] right
[patient] it was cool to see nothing
[doctor] yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they
[patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that
[doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right
[patient] yes
[doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that
[patient] yes twice a day
[doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed
[patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control
[doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct
[patient] that's correct yes
[doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct
[patient] yes that's right
[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you
[patient] kills
[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit
[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
[doctor] yeah yeah well
[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore
[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime

- Examination of the right upper extremity: Moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness. Moderate pain with passive range of motion. No palpable joint effusion. Mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right elbow taken today is reviewed and shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality. There is no malalignment or joint effusion. Otherwise normal right elbow x-ray.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute lateral epicondylitis of right elbow.
- Medical Reasoning: Patient presents today with symptoms consistent with lateral epicondylitis secondary to overuse.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed. He was advised that this is like due to increased tennis activity and was encouraged to rest as much as possible. - Medical Treatment: Patient will discontinue playing tennis for the next 4 to 6 weeks, as well as avoid repetitive stress with the right arm. He will apply ice to the elbow for at least 20 minutes 3 times per day to reduce pain and inflammation. Right forearm brace was provided today to help with discomfort. Prescription for Ultram 50 mg once per day was also provided for pain.

2. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: His blood sugar today is not controlled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that I would like him to take his blood sugars twice a day for the next 2 weeks and to let me know how they are running so we can make additional adjustments if needed.
- Medical Treatment: He will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. He will begin home blood sugar monitoring twice a day for the next 2 weeks. Hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and a Chem-12 test were ordered today.

3. Mild acute intermittent asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: This remains well-controlled.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will continue his Flovent twice a day. Refill of albuterol provided today to be used as needed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test obtained today is reviewed and findings are consistent with asthma.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Moderate intermittent asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and results of her PFT are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of consistency with her daily inhaler as this will help prevent daily symptoms and the need to use the albuterol inhaler as frequently. My hope is that she has less acute exacerbations as she continues to use her inhaled steroid.
- Medical Treatment: Prescribed provided for Flovent 110 mcg 1 puff twice per day. She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs. I am also going to put together an asthma action plan for her so we know what to do based on her symptoms.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend
[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah
[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
[doctor] okay
[patient] let me separate these
[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
[patient] no nothing like that
[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness
[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no
[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
[patient] no
[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection
[patient] alright thank you
[doctor] alright thank you
[patient] bye","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Larry Garcia is a pleasant 41-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain.

The onset of his pain began 2 years ago, after moving furniture. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain as sharp and stabbing. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates distally into his right leg and occasionally into his great toe. Sitting will increase his pain and he notes he is unable to get comfortable. The patient also reports numbness and tingling, especially in his right leg that radiates distally to his foot. He adds that he tries to be as active as he can, however it has been difficult with his back pain. The patient adds that he has gained weight over the past year. He denies any loss of sensation in his genital or rectal area, weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control.

In the past, he has attended physical therapy. The patient has also been prescribed pain medications, however they only provided temporary relief. He would like to avoid any surgical procedure at this time.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He quit smoking 20 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient denies any family history of spine conditions.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports weight gain.
Musculoskeletal: Reports lower back pain.
Neurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in the right leg and foot. Denies loss of bowl or bladder control, or loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area.

VITALS

Vitals are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness at L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion. Supine straight leg test is positive.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. This revealed a disc herniation with nerve impingement.

ASSESSMENT

L4-5 herniated disc with radiculopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his symptoms are consistent with an L4-5 herniated disc with radiculopathy. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy.

"[patient] hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since

[patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards
[doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance
[patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore
[doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before
[patient] no that was the first time
[doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake
[patient] lake martin
[doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier
[patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can
[doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day
[patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway
[doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked
[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] no just the swelling and the pain
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
[doctor] okay and
[patient] putting a cold pack on it
[doctor] okay and has that helped at all
[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though
[doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here
[patient] i had my tonsils out
[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press
[patient] yeah that's sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore
[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan
[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions
[patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me
[doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye
[patient] thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Cough.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of rheumatoid arthritis. He denies any previous history of lung infections or pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he stopped smoking tobacco 7 years ago and has felt better since doing so. He notes that he enjoys biking.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his mother has a history of breast cancer, but is doing well. He denies any family history of lung cancer.

MEDICATIONS

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 70 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No clicks, rubs, or murmurs. Pulses are intact in all extremities.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.

Integumentary
- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.

RESULTS

CT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.
- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",S: I went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but they did that chest x-ray to make sure I didn't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule I went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you I'm really nervous document.

- Medical Reasoning: The patient describes difficulty swallowing when he eats solid foods.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that I am concerned he has a narrowing in his throat that is causing this. I advised the patient the gastroenterology will do a scope. I recommended Prilosec as he might be experiencing reflux. We discussed that he should eat his food slowly and chew his food frequently. I advised the patient to call our office if his symptoms worsen.
- Medical Treatment: I referred the patient to gastroenterology. I prescribed Prilosec 20 mg once a day.

2. Diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: This seems well-controlled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient will continue with his metformin as he seems to be doing well. I advised the patient to follow up in 1 month for results and any adjustments that may be needed.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 500 mg twice a day. I ordered another hemoglobin A1c, as well as a kidney function test. I referred the patient to ophthalmology for retinopathy.

3. High blood pressure.
- Medical Reasoning: This seems well-controlled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to continue his current medication, Norvasc.
- Medical Treatment: I refilled the Norvasc.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow-up in 1 month for his diabetic lab results and any modifications needed.","S: difficulty swallowing... something is always stuck in my throat... have to wash it down on occasion. painful... solids require more effort... never fully choked but worried about choking. chew food thoroughly, avoid hard solids without care... ER if food gets stuck. | O: noticed over the last four to five weeks. Norvasc refill requested and provided. | A: no coughing... no blood in stools or vomiting... no weight loss, chest pain, or shortness of breath. no neck swelling, masses, or lymph nodes... normal thyroid... clear lungs, normal heart... epigastric tenderness. | P: taking metformin 500 mg twice a day... checks blood sugars ~80% of the time... within target range. Norvasc... blood pressure in office 120/50... home readings occasionally lower but mostly in range. narrowing in the throat/esophagus... possible stricture requiring dilation. refer to gastroenterology for scope... start Prilosec 20 mg daily. repeat hemoglobin A1c, kidney function tests... eye referral for retinopathy.","The patient experiences difficulty in swallowing, with a sensation that something is constantly stuck in their throat. They described the symptom as painful and reported that swallowing solids requires more effort. Despite this, the patient has never fully choked. To manage the symptom, they chew their food thoroughly and avoid hard solids. However, if food gets stuck, they plan to seek medical attention in an emergency room.","Over the past four to five weeks, the patient has reported the onset of new symptoms. During a physical examination, no specific findings were noted. However, the patient requested a refill of Norvasc, an antihypertensive medication, which was provided by the healthcare provider.","The assessment reveals that the patient did not present with several common symptoms associated with various health conditions. Notably, there was no evidence of coughing, blood in stools or vomiting, weight loss, chest pain, shortness of breath, neck swelling, masses, or enlarged lymph nodes. Additionally, the thyroid function was normal, and the lungs were clear with a normal heart rate. However, the patient did exhibit epigastric tenderness. The clinical reasoning suggests that the absence of these symptoms may indicate a less severe condition, but the presence of epigastric tenderness could indicate gastrointestinal issues such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or a peptic ulcer. Further testing, such as a gastroscopy or ultrasound, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.","The patient is currently undergoing treatment that includes taking metformin tablets with a dosage of 500 mg twice a day. To monitor the effectiveness of the medication, they check their blood sugar levels around 80% of the time, ensuring they remain within the target range. In addition, they are taking Norvasc for managing their blood pressure, which is measured in the doctor's office at 120/50 mmHg. However, home readings occasionally show lower values but generally remain within the desired range.

A potential issue with a narrowing in the throat or esophagus, possibly leading to a stricture, has been identified. The patient is referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation through a scope procedure. They are also prescribed Prilosec tablets with a dosage of 20 mg daily to address any related symptoms.

Additionally, the healthcare provider has scheduled follow-up tests, including repeating hemoglobin A1c and kidney function tests. Furthermore, the patient is advised to undergo an eye referral to assess for any signs of retinopathy.","S: The patient experiences difficulty in swallowing, with a sensation that something is constantly stuck in their throat.

Jerry Cook is a 45-year-old male who presents today with a right ankle injury.

The patient sustained an injury to the right ankle while playing basketball with his son. He reports he landed awkwardly and twisted his right ankle after jumping to make a layup. His pain is primarily located along the lateral aspect of the right ankle. He notes bruising and swelling. The patient is able to weight-bear while standing. He experiences pain and feelings of instability within the ankle while ambulating and is concerned for further injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works from home and plans to coach his son’s basketball team in 04/2022. He enjoys working out and reports he recently resumed engaging in a consistent gym routine.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain and instability.
Skin: Reports right ankle bruising and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Brisk capillary refill.
SKIN: No epidermolysis. Intact.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Exquisite tenderness laterally. Mild tenderness over the medial deltoid region. Swelling on the lateral side of the ankle. No horrible malalignment.

RESULTS

X-rays, including AP, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle, were obtained in the office and reviewed today. These demonstrate a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There is no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Right lateral malleolar fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options. Recommendation was made for an open reduction internal fixation of the right ankle. We discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as the postoperative recovery period following surgery. I advised that it will be 3 months before he can resume his exercise routine. In the meantime, I will prescribe meloxicam to reduce swelling. I recommended he ice and elevate the ankle as well. He will be given crutches to assist with ambulation.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",,,,,,"S:

"[patient] miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male
[doctor] how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today
[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor
[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
[doctor] pain excess
[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided facial pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.
HENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat
Bilateral finger rub test is negative.
- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.

RESULTS

MRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Trigeminal neuralgia.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.
- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.","S: stabbing shooting pain... cheek bone area... episodes... super hot... for a couple of months probably for about two or three months... came on slowly certain temperatures... cold... wind ibuprofen and motrin... tiger balm... didn't work memory loss tingling imbalance... dermatologic reactions follow up in about a month numb on my side... dull on my left side... sharp on the left tegretol... genetic testing...

Right knee injury

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. Her injury was sustained while skiing in Vermont last weekend after she caught her ski when coming off of the lift and fell. She reports a pop in her knee at the time of injury and has been experiencing pain since that time. Due to her fall she was unable to weight bear and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She locates her pain to the lateral aspect of her knee and also describes the feeling of instability as well as buckling. At this time she is experiencing difficulty with knee flexion; however, she states this was not a problem immediately after the injury. Full knee extension is also quite painful for her. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes. She is currently utilizing crutches for ambulation which were provided to her by the ski patrol. In terms of pain control, she is taking ibuprofen which is providing some relief.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is otherwise healthy and denies a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is very active with skiing and taking care of her 4-year-old twins. She mentions that she would like to get back into running at some point. She states that her husband is home with her, but he also works a job where he has gone quite a bit.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports she is taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and limited range of motion.
Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in toes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: The patient is ambulating with crutches.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear to auscultation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Edema and effusion noted. Pain with palpation of the lateral knee. Decreased flexion and extension. Positive Lachman's. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. No ankle edema.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken today. These reveal no bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible ACL tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.

[doctor] okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what
[patient] just sometimes it bruises
[doctor] okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired
[patient] well since the accident yes
[doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
[patient] it hurts it hurts
[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[doctor] no not by any means i am saying
[patient] pain i have a lot of pain
[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[patient] said it might be broken
[doctor] what
[patient] pamela said it might be broken
[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[patient] i ca n't go to work like this
[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay any other questions
[patient] not right now
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Neck pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brandon Green is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. His pain began when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 02/2022 when he was on his way home from a pain clinic. The patient notes that he has been in 4 motor vehicle accidents; however, he notes that he was fine after the first two accidents, but the third motor vehicle accident is when his neck and back pain began. He states that he was in therapy following the second accident and had surgery after his third accident. The patient was seen at a pain clinic secondary to neck and back pain. He was prescribed fentanyl; however, he has not received a prescription for several weeks. Today, he reports that his pain is a 12 out of 10. He describes his pain as sharp and incapacitating with stiffness and pain. The patient also reports headaches, occasional dizziness. He denies any recent visual disturbances. He also reports numbness in his left arm and right leg. The patient also reports spasms throughout his body. He states that he has been experiencing fatigue since the accident. He notes that he is unable to work with this much pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue.
Eyes: Denies any recent visual disturbances.
Musculoskeletal: Reports neck and back pain, and occasional swelling and bruising of the neck.
Neurological: Reports headaches, dizziness, spasms, and numbness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: No lacerations.
MSK: Examination of the cervical spine: Pain on palpation on the bony process and muscle. Moderate ROM. No bruising or edema noted.

RESULTS

X-rays of the neck reveal no fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Neck sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommended an MRI for further evaluation. I have also prescribed the patient Robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours to treat his pain. I have also advised him to utilize ice, a heating pad, IcyHot, or Biofreeze on his neck as needed. I have also provided him with a home exercise program to work on his range of motion. I advised the patient that he will not be able to work until we have the MRI results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me after his MRI for results.",S: that's when i was coming home from the pain clinic because my neck hurt and my back hurt but that was in february they had prescribed it recently i was i was on fentanyl [...] i have n't gotten a prescription for several weeks it's the sharp incapacitating pain i ca n't work i want you to put ice on that [...] and roll through these exercises every morning we're gon na give you off for work because you ca n't move | O: the third crash i had surgery but i was fine until this crash | A: i was in a car crash on a scale of one to ten [...] twelve numbness [patient] my left arm and my leg any spasms [patient] of course pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle moderate range of movement robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours | P: we're gon na upgrade to an mri we'll see about locally injecting the area,"The patient had been experiencing pain in both their neck and back, which had led them to visit a pain clinic in February. They had been prescribed fentanyl to manage the pain, but had not received a new prescription for several weeks. The pain was described as sharp and incapacitating, making it difficult for the patient to work. The healthcare professional was advised to apply ice to the affected areas and guide the patient through specific exercises every morning due to their inability to move. The patient was granted a leave of absence from work as a result.","The patient underwent surgery following the third vehicular accident they were involved in. Initially, they showed signs of recovery and appeared to be in good condition. However, after the most recent crash, their health status deteriorated. No specific objective findings from physical examinations or test results were provided in the given context to elaborate on the nature of their current condition.","The patient described being involved in a car crash with a severity of twelve, resulting in numbness in their left arm and leg. Spasms were also reported, accompanied by pain upon palpation in both the bony processes and muscles. The patient's range of movement was moderate, and they were prescribed Robaxin at a dosage of 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Based on the patient's symptoms, it is likely that they have sustained soft tissue injuries, potentially including contusions, strains, or even nerve damage. The prescription of Robaxin, a muscle relaxant, supports this diagnosis and is intended to help manage pain and muscle spasms. Further assessment and diagnostic tests may be necessary to rule out more severe injuries or complications.","In the planned treatment, the individual will undergo an upgrade to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Following this, there are intentions to locally inject the affected area.","S: The patient had been experiencing pain in both their neck and back, which had led them to visit a pain clinic in February.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Beverly Ortiz is a 24-year-old female patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. She is here today for her yearly exam.

Diabetes mellitus type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: Her blood glucose levels have been uncontrolled. She is still taking metformin twice a day, but does admit to dietary indiscretion with an increase in her sweets intake.. Her most recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.
• Medical Treatment: Continue metformin twice a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to check her fasting blood glucose levels each morning and call them in about 2 weeks. She will follow up in about 2 months, at which time we will discuss further treatment recommendations.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Appears to be relatively stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 10 mg once daily.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Beverly's a 24-year-old female patient, and I know you have a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. You're here today for your yearly exam. Haven't seen you in a year. I began working in a bakery this summer [...] but I find myself snacking a lot during shifts and eating a lot more desserts than I normally would. My blood sugars have been up and down because of my diet [...] I haven't missed anything [medication], but my diet has been pretty bad lately. My blood pressure's been good, despite my diabetes levels being up and down. I'm not gonna change your medication. This is diet-related [...] cut down on snacking and additional sweets [...] check your blood sugars in the morning [...] follow up in two months. We'll see you in about two months [...] if [blood sugars] haven't improved, we'll talk about adding another medication. | O: Your hypertension seems stable [...] stay on lisinopril 10mg once daily. No changes at this point. | A: Getting a full eight hours. Your hemoglobin A1c is elevated. | P: Your exam is essentially normal [...] your heart is regular [...] grade 2 systolic ejection murmur [...] lungs are clear [...] neurovascular intact, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly, no edema, pulses are good.","Beverly, a 24-year-old female patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, attended her annual examination. The doctor noted a year's absence and expressed concern about her recent employment at a bakery, leading to increased snacking and sugar consumption. As a result, her blood sugar levels have been inconsistent. Despite adhering to her medication regimen, her dietary habits have worsened. Fortunately, her blood pressure levels have remained stable. The doctor advised Beverly to reduce her snacking and limit additional sweets. She was encouraged to monitor her blood sugar levels in the morning and scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two months. If her blood sugar levels did not improve, additional medication would be considered.","The patient's hypertension remains unchanged, and their current medication regimen of lisinopril 10mg once daily continues to be effective. No adjustments are necessary at this time.","The individual's sleep pattern indicates they are getting an adequate amount of rest, with a consistent eight hours each night. However, despite this, their hemoglobin A1c level is above the normal range. This assessment suggests that the person may have an underlying condition, such as diabetes, that is not fully controlled with their current sleep habits. The clinician may consider further investigation into the individual's glucose levels and insulin production, and may recommend dietary modifications, increased physical activity, or medication adjustments to help manage their blood sugar levels.","The patient's examination results reveal generally normal findings. The heart function is regular with a mild systolic ejection murmur identified. Lungs are clear, indicating good respiratory health. Neurological and vascular systems are intact, with no signs of carotid bruits or thyromegaly, and no evidence of edema or impaired pulses.

Treatment and Follow-up:
Given the normal examination results, no immediate treatment is required. The patient will be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the ejection murmur and ensure ongoing cardiovascular health. Any changes or concerns should be reported to the healthcare provider promptly.","S: Beverly, a 24-year-old female patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, attended her annual examination. The doctor noted a year's absence and expressed concern about her recent employment at a bakery, leading to increased snacking and sugar consumption. As a result, her blood sugar levels have been inconsistent. Despite adhering to her medication regimen, her dietary habits have worsened. Fortunately, her blood pressure levels have remained stable. The doctor advised Beverly to reduce her snacking and limit additional sweets. She was encouraged to monitor her blood sugar levels in the morning and scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two months. If her blood sugar levels did not improve, additional medication would be considered.
O: The patient's hypertension remains unchanged, and their current medication regimen of lisinopril 10mg once daily continues to be effective. No adjustments are necessary at this time.
A: The individual's sleep pattern indicates they are getting an adequate amount of rest, with a consistent eight hours each night. However, despite this, their hemoglobin A1c level is above the normal range. This assessment suggests that the person may have an underlying condition, such as diabetes, that is not fully controlled with their current sleep habits. The clinician may consider further investigation into the individual's glucose levels and insulin production, and may recommend dietary modifications, increased physical activity, or medication adjustments to help manage their blood sugar levels.
P: The patient's examination results reveal generally normal findings. The heart function is regular with a mild systolic ejection murmur identified. Lungs are clear, indicating good respiratory health. Neurological and vascular systems are intact, with no signs of carotid bruits or thyromegaly, and no evidence of edema or impaired pulses.

ASSESSMENT

Anna Morris is a 26-year-old female with a past medical history significant for epilepsy, depression, and peptic ulcer disease who presents with some joint pain.

PLAN

Left elbow pain.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe she has left olecranon bursitis caused by repetitive trauma.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to use a pillow to rest her arm on. She may also ice the area.

Epilepsy.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been doing well on Keppra and denies any recent seizures.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Keppra 500 mg twice a day. This was refilled today.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports doing well with therapy.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Lexapro 10 mg once daily.

Peptic ulcer disease.
• Medical Reasoning: Her recent endoscopy revealed gastritis
• Medical Treatment: Continue Protonix 40 mg once daily before meals.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: left elbow that's really been bothering me... after work, it's really hard for me to open and close my left elbow, and it's been just really stiff and, and hurts. therapy has been good... still feel a little down and stressed, | O: a little bit of weakness no fever or chills. last seizure was a year ago, peptic ulcer disease... endoscopy showed gastritis. continue Protonix 40mg before meals. right-handed... can still write, no suicidal or homicidal ideations. | A: olecranon bursitis caused by repetitive trauma It's just caused by repetitive trauma left arm x-ray shows no evidence of elbow fracture, | P: swelling there on the tip no numbing or tingling in hands, still taking Keppra, erythema and edema of the left elbow, pain to palpation of the olecranon, warm to palpation, pain with flexion and extension. meloxicam 15mg once a day, continue Keppra 500mg twice daily, start Lexapro 10mg once daily, nasal congestion from allergies, endoscopy results showed gastritis. understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","The patient has been experiencing discomfort and stiffness in their left elbow, making it difficult for them to open and close it after work hours. The elbow has been causing pain, adding to their distress. Despite undergoing therapy, they continue to feel a degree of discomfort and are still affected by feelings of sadness and stress.","The patient displayed mild weakness with no signs of fever or chills. Their last seizure occurred a year prior. The medical history included peptic ulcer disease, which was evidenced by the results of an endoscopy showing gastritis. The patient continued to take Protonix, a medication for managing ulcers, at a dosage of 40mg before meals. The patient was right-handed and was still able to write. There were no indications of suicidal or homicidal ideations.","The patient has been diagnosed with olecranon bursitis in the left elbow. This condition is attributed to repetitive trauma. An x-ray examination of the affected elbow did not reveal any evidence of a fracture. The clinical reasoning behind this diagnosis is based on the patient's symptoms and the absence of other apparent causes, such as infection or crystal-induced inflammation. The repetitive trauma could be due to various causes, such as frequent elbow bending, leaning on the elbow, or direct blows to the olecranon. The diagnosis is confirmed through physical examination, which reveals signs of inflammation, such as swelling, warmth, and tenderness, in the olecranon bursa. Treatment may include rest, ice, compression, and elevation of the affected elbow, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage pain and inflammation. In some cases, aspiration of the bursa may be necessary to alleviate symptoms.","The patient is experiencing swelling on the tip of their finger without numbness or tingling in their hands, as well as erythema and edema on their left elbow. They continue to take Keppra at a dosage of 500mg twice daily. The patient reports pain upon palpation of the olecranon and finds the area to be warm. Flexion and extension of the elbow cause pain. A new medication, meloxicam, is prescribed at a dosage of 15mg once daily. The patient is instructed to continue taking Keppra and is also prescribed Lexapro at a dosage of 10mg once daily. The patient is dealing with nasal congestion due to allergies. Endoscopy results have revealed the presence of gastritis.

Back pain.

HPI:

Ms. Lee is a 40-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of back pain. She states she was at a birthday party and she ran her back into the railing of the staircase and twisted her back. She denies any pain radiating down her legs. Lying flat and twisting motions aggravate the pain. She is currently taking ibuprofen.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Anxiety.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Lumbar fusion

EXAM

Examination of the back shows range of motion without pain. Straight leg raise is negative. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine show no obvious signs of acute fracture. Evidence of a prior lumbar fusion with hardware in good position.

IMPRESSION

Lumbar spine strain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and heat. She will continue with Motrin 800 mg 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me as needed.","S: I was at a birthday party...rammed my back into the railing of the staircase. And maybe a twisting. If I'm lying flat it hurts a little more, and any twisting motion for sure. You have a strain of your lower back. Continue the Motrin at 800mg, three times a day with food. I want you to use some ice and heat, alternating on your back. But I do want you walking. If it's not [improving], or it's getting worse, I want you to come back and see me over the next week. | O: It's more on the [side] I had a fusion done I take medication for anxiety Straight leg raise is negative | A: It doesn't appear to have any compression fractures or anything that... essentially, except for the fusion, a normal exam. | P: Sensation is intact","The patient reported an incident at a birthday party where they accidentally rammed their back into the staircase railing and experienced a twisting motion. This resulted in discomfort, particularly when lying flat and when performing twisting motions. The patient was diagnosed with a lower back strain and was prescribed Motrin at a dosage of 800mg, three times a day with food. The patient was advised to use ice and heat, alternating between the two, on the affected area. They were encouraged to continue walking, but if symptoms did not improve or worsened, they were instructed to return for further evaluation within the next week.","The individual underwent a physical examination which revealed the presence of a fusion on the side. They reportedly take medication to manage anxiety symptoms. During the straight leg raise test, no signs of nerve compression or irritation were observed as the result came back negative.","The assessment reveals that the patient's examination did not indicate the presence of compression fractures or any other notable abnormalities, aside from the fusion. In simpler terms, the examination was essentially normal, with the exception of the identified fusion.",The patient's sensation remains intact following the treatment. No loss of feeling has been reported or observed. The healthcare team will continue to monitor the patient's condition closely during the follow-up appointments to ensure the sensory function remains stable. Any changes or concerns regarding sensation will be promptly addressed.,"S: The patient reported an incident at a birthday party where they accidentally rammed their back into the staircase railing and experienced a twisting motion.

[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've been trying to get up and get active . and i've- ... all of a sudden i've been feeling some really bad , um , knee pain-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?

[doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?
[patient] that's been going really well .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .
[doctor] sleeping well ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
[patient] that's doing-
[doctor] any flare up with that ?
[patient] . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?

[patient] yeah , that hurts too .
[doctor] okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Thompson is a 27 y.o. female who presents today for evaluation of right knee pain.

Chondromalacia of right patella.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been more active lately but is unaware of any injury to the knee. Her recent x-rays were normal but she did have some discomfort on exam.
• Medical Treatment: Prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg 4 times a day with food. I do want her to do some straight leg raising exercises that will strengthen her quadriceps.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to participate in physical activity that is less straining on her joints , such as swimming freestyle laps, or to stop activity all together. If her pain does not improve in a couple of weeks, she will follow up.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: This is stable and well-controlled at this time.
• Medical Treatment: She should continue swimming regularly once her knee is feeling better.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with her current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current medications.

Carpal tunnel syndrome.
• Medical Reasoning: Relatively stable status post carpal tunnel release.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen with no changes at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: only while swimming.

Lyme titer: elevated.

Labs: WBC is within normal limits. All other labs are normal as well.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents with abnormal labs.

Newly diagnosed Lyme disease.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue for her. She presented with an insect bite at her last visit, and her subsequent lyme titer was elevated.
• Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. I am going to touch base with an infectious disease doctor to ensure nothing else that needs to be done. I want to see her again next week for follow-up for this.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This has been well-controlled based on home monitoring. She has been compliant with dietary modifications including limiting her sodium intake.
• Additional Testing: I am going to order a lipid panel.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg a day. This was refilled today.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to continue to regularly monitor her blood pressures at home.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed intermittent elevations of her blood glucose levels but has been compliant with the use of metformin. Her diet has been limited due to nausea in the setting of Lyme disease.
• Additional Testing: I am going to order a hemoglobin A1c to ensure no medication changes are needed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I've been feeling tired, really lacking a lot of energy, and I have swollen joints in my elbows, just really hurts.

The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in a week.
A: The healthcare professional has examined the patient's lab results and noted that most readings are within normal ranges. However, they plan to consult an infectious disease specialist to ensure no further tests are necessary. The doctor will also order a hemoglobin A1c test to assess the patient's blood sugar control and maintain the current metformin dosage. The patient's hypertension management is commended, and the doctor will continue prescribing lisinopril at 10mg daily and order a lipid panel.
P: Michelle, a 31-year-old woman with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, comes into the clinic with abnormal lab results. The healthcare team reviews Michelle's medical history and current lab findings. Based on the results, the team diagnoses Michelle with uncontrolled diabetes.

The treatment plan for Michelle includes:

1. Adjusting her current diabetes medication regimen to better control her blood sugar levels.
2. Providing education on diet and exercise to help manage her diabetes.
3. Initiating regular follow-up appointments with her healthcare provider to monitor her blood sugar levels and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
4. Prescribing medication to manage her hypertension if her blood pressure remains elevated.
5. Encouraging Michelle to attend diabetes education classes to learn more about managing her condition.

The follow-up plan for Michelle includes:

1. Regularly scheduled appointments with her healthcare provider to monitor her diabetes and hypertension.
2. Frequent monitoring of her blood sugar levels at home and reporting any significant changes to her healthcare provider.
3. Adhering to her prescribed medication regimen and reporting"

"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
• Allergic rhinitis.
• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","S: Alvesco will be prescribed as a trial, with Wixela kept as a backup. | O: Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.","S: I saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations.

[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid “heavy foods,” but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful. The patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS

• Gastrointestinal: Positive nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Alert and cooperative, appears stated age.

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
Heart regular rate and rhythm.

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Normoactive bowel sounds.

ASSESSMENT

• Irritable bowel syndrome

Brittany Edwards is a 32-year-old established patient who returned today to discuss management of IBS and functional abdominal pain made worse by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits.

PLAN

I have encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator, such as Elavil 25 mg at bedtime for IBS. She can use Bentyl 20 mg as needed 30-45 minutes before eating out at a restaurant. She can also use Zofran as needed for nausea. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy fatty foods and alcohol consumption.

INSTRUCTIONS

Send MyChart message in 1 month regarding any side effects of issues with Elavil or if dose adjustments are needed.
Return to clinic in 1 month or sooner if needed.","S: She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea.

A: During a follow-up appointment, the patient presented with persistent symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms were reported to affect both the upper and lower abdomen. The healthcare provider suggested modifications to the patient's diet, recommending they reduce their intake of greasy or fatty foods and alcohol. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment via MyChart email in one month to evaluate the effectiveness of these dietary changes and monitor for potential medication side effects.

At the next appointment, the patient reported no improvement with Citrucel, a fiber supplement previously prescribed. Instead, they mentioned that avoiding sodas and drinking more water had led to noticeable symptom improvement. The healthcare provider acknowledged these findings and encouraged the patient to continue exploring alternative fiber sources while avoiding triggers that worsened their IBS symptoms.
P: The individual's previous discussion with their healthcare provider revolved around neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar. However, these medications have not been initiated for their treatment."
"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
• Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
• Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
• Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus.
• Gait impairment.
• Urinary incontinence and urgency.
• Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Amanda Taylor is an 72-year-old woman who presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

Mrs. Taylor admits to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week and is interested in Naltrexone injections. She acknowledges that her blood pressure would likely improve if she stopped alcohol consumption. She is checking her blood pressure in the morning and evening, stating it is higher at night but will improve after sitting for a few minutes. She is averaged 135-145 or 150 over 95-110.

She experienced side effects from lisinopril, such as headaches, “swooshing” in her left ear, and lethargy. She took half a dose and did not experience the side effects.

ASSESSMENT

• Alcohol use disorder.
• Hypertension.

Mrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

Full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.

The patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.

Ms. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Genitourinary
Pelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.

ASSESSMENT

• Screening for sexually transmitted disease.

"[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
[doctor] fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Rheumatoid arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Nelson is a 72-year-old male who presents today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis. He was last seen by me on 03/04/2021, where he received a steroid injection to his right knee. He continues to experience right knee pain and swelling. The pain level is 6/10. He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to ""get his bearings."" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Lower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.

PROCEDURE

Fluid aspiration and Steroid injection.
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.

ASSESSMENT

• Rheumatoid arthritis management.
• High risk medication use.
• Right knee pain.
• Lower extremity pitting edema.

PLAN

Rheumatoid arthritis management.
The patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.

High-risk medication use.
The patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.

Right knee pain.
He has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.

Lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions.","S: i'm taking it everyday, and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago. We can give you another steroid injection for that.

If current treatments prove ineffective, a surgical consultation may be necessary. The knee was previously not swollen, and the patient has attempted using compression socks without success.","The patient presented for his regular appointment to manage his rheumatoid arthritis. His symptoms had flared up for the past couple of weeks, with swelling in the knees and ankles, accompanied by an increase in joint pain.

Prior to the procedure, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient, and verbal consent was obtained.","The patient undergoes a treatment plan aimed at improving their range of motion, which has been found to be slightly diminished. The specifics of the treatment regimen are as follows:

Initially, the patient receives manual therapy sessions to help restore normal joint mobility and flexibility. These sessions may include techniques such as joint mobilization, soft tissue mobilization, and passive stretching. The frequency and duration of these sessions will depend on the severity of the range of motion limitations.

In addition to manual therapy, the patient is prescribed a series of home exercises to be performed daily. These exercises are designed to improve joint mobility, flexibility, and muscle strength in the affected area. The patient is encouraged to perform these exercises consistently to maximize their benefits.

The patient may also be advised to use heat or cold therapy to help alleviate any discomfort or inflammation associated with the limited range of motion. The use of braces, splints, or other supportive devices may also be recommended to help maintain proper alignment and reduce strain on the affected area.

Throughout the treatment process, the patient's progress is closely monitored through regular follow-up appointments.

"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

• Perioral dermatitis
• Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist’s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.","S: I started using doxycycline only one a day because the pharmacist said if it's getting better, to just limit it to once a day. When I started doing it only once a day, it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better. It's kinda plateaued a little bit. I didn’t take the elidel because when I read about it I got worried. The pharmacist said if it's getting better, to just limit it to once a day. The insurance is not covering [Elidel]. It was coming to around $850 after insurance. I would do something really basic like Vanicream. Or even, if it's just really dry, you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly. | O: Fitzpatrick skin type IV to V. | A: Bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils. You're using the metro cream? Yes. After my face wash, I immediately apply the cream. Continue using the same face wash, continue with metro cream, and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day. Twice a day until rash is gone, and once a day for another week before stopping. Gently wash her eyelids once a day with a gentle cleanser such as Vanicream, also use Bruder mask as needed. Doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn. It will make you sunburn, even if you never sunburn. It can cause this weird tingly or needle-sensation or make it redder or flush. But it should only last a few seconds and go away. | P: It's doing much better. No, I'm not [breastfeeding]. I would go ahead and go back to twice a day, every day, with the doxycycline. We could try ointment form [tacrolimus]. Stay away from any anti-aging thing, any plant thing.","The patient has been taking doxycycline once a day as prescribed by the pharmacist after noticing no further improvement in their condition. They have refrained from using Elidel due to concerns and high cost, approximately $850 after insurance. Instead, they consider using simpler alternatives such as Vanicream or petroleum jelly for dryness.","The individual's Fitzpatrick skin type is classified as IV to V. This means that they have a medium to dark complexion, with a higher susceptibility to sun damage and skin cancer due to the lower amount of melanin in their skin. This classification is based on the skin's reaction to sunlight and its ability to tan or burn.","The patient presents with faint erythematous papules and redness around and underneath the nostrils on both medial cheeks. The patient uses Metro cream after face wash.

[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs

[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain

Abdominal pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying nature photography.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No murmurs, clicks, or rubs.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","S: pain in my belly that I've had for several weeks Most of the time it comes after I eat, either immediately or a couple of hours later Both my dad and my mom had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders out Still having pain despite dietary changes | O: Right-sided abdominal pain underneath my ribs, squeezing and severe (rated 8/10), comes and goes, accompanied by nausea Low-grade fevers during severe pain episodes, no vomiting | A: Positive for Murphy's sign, slight guarding in the right upper quadrant without rebound tenderness Abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones in the gallbladder with mild thickening; common bile duct size normal at 4.1 mm Mild cholecystitis with gallstones, no frank obstruction Recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgery to take 1–1.5 hours, overnight hospital stay for monitoring See you next week for surgery, then follow-up 1 week post-op | P: Type 2 diabetes managed with diet and exercise; followed a keto diet, lost 25 pounds Avoid high-fat foods, eat high-fiber foods; resume walking in 1–2 days, no hiking until post-op week Back on your feet pretty quick; can walk outdoors on solid ground after a couple of days Continue managing diabetes with diet/exercise; follow up with primary care/endocrinologist Enjoys nature photography and hiking; plans to resume outdoor activities post-surgery","The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain for several weeks.

Right shoulder injury.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture. The plan is to place the patient in a sling and prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat his pain. I also recommend that we obtain a CT scan of the right shoulder to evaluate further. I recommend that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen his right shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future. In the meantime, I have advised him to avoid tackle football.",S: I kinda landed on my shoulder a little bit weird one time. about four days ago. it's kinda on the back side around here. they are about the same I can't lift my shoulder to touch my ear because of pain. just a little bit of Tylenol trying to take it easy. Tylenol does not provide relief. the rest of it's doing it's just the shoulder. I'm right-handed. had an appendectomy maybe three-four years ago. put you in a sling. when can I get back out on the field? our bones get a little bit weaker as we get older. | O: Right shoulder injury. palpable radial artery pulse. acute acromioclavicular joint fracture. prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day. order a CT scan of your shoulder. refer you to physical therapy. | A: avoid tackle football flag football in the future. a slight headache | P: no numbness or tingling in my fingers. pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint. decreased abduction and adduction to about ninety degrees only. pain with supination and pronation of the arm.,"The patient, being right-handed, experienced an awkward fall approximately four days prior, landing on their left shoulder. The discomfort is situated on the backside of the shoulder and prevents the individual from raising their arm high enough to touch their ear due to pain. Over-the-counter Tylenol has not brought any relief. The injury seems to be isolated to the shoulder, and the patient underwent an appendectomy around three to four years ago. A sling was utilized during recovery. The patient expresses concern about the length of time before they can return to their activities, acknowledging that bones weaken as we age.","The patient presented with an injury to the right shoulder.

[patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since
[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty
[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point
[doctor] okay great thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Due to the patient's current respiratory symptoms, medication adjustments were made, including an increase in metformin dosage to 750 mg twice daily and holding off on Norvasc until the shortness of breath was addressed. The patient was referred to the emergency department for further evaluation. Additional tests, such as another hemoglobin A1c, were ordered for future discussion on diabetes treatment. The patient was advised to return in about three weeks for a follow-up appointment.
P: The patient is currently following a treatment plan that involves consuming three to four cups of a specific substance each day. The exact nature of this substance is not clear from the provided information. The treatment is expected to last for around three weeks. After completing the treatment, the patient will undergo follow-up appointments to monitor their progress and assess the effectiveness of the therapy."
"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened

[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Scott Miller is a pleasant 36-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The injury occurred 3 days ago, when he was playing pickup soccer games and felt a pop in his right knee. He reports swelling at the time of the injury, which has improved. The patient states that his knee is not as functional or moving as well as it used to be. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 7 out of 10 currently and a 4 to 5 out of 10 when the swelling decreases. The patient has been taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, which provides some relief. He states that he is able to bend his knee with pain towards the end of this motion; however, when he goes to straighten his knee, he feels like he has to help it straight. The patient adds that he is able to bear weight on his right knee, however it feels loose and does not feel normal.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works at a desk.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: Marked limp in the right leg upon ambulation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Significant effusion. Slight ecchymosis. Pain with palpation at the medial joint line. Difficulty with passive ROM. Lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to 115 degrees. Lacking 20-30 degrees of terminal flexion secondary to pain. Positive Lachman's test. Muscle strength is 5/5. Neurovascular intact distally.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible anterior cruciate ligament tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of the ACL. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg a day to reduce swelling and pain. We discussed that the patient should utilize ice and activity modification to reduce swelling and pain. I recommended that he wears a knee immobilizer and use crutches when he is ambulating. He will avoid jogging until we have the results of his MRI.

INSTRUCTIONS

[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that

[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside

[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah

[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far

[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Teresa Sullivan is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain. Her pain began 4 days ago, without any improvement. She denies any specific injury; however, she has recently increased her usage of a pottery wheel in creating a bowl for her son. She is currently unable to work with the pottery wheel secondary to pain. Her pain is in the medial aspect of her elbow. She notes it radiates medially down her arm as well. The patient rates her pain level as 7 out of 10 at its worst. She reports the pain wakes her at night if she rolls over. She denies ibuprofen or ice provide pain relief.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right elbow was reviewed today. It demonstrated no evidence of any fractures. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right elbow pain, consistent with medial epicondylitis.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.

I have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.

The patient’s hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise. I have instructed her to continue taking lisinopril 10 mg. I also encouraged her to continue with her walking routine.

All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the hemoglobin A1c test and discuss her progress.","S: pain radiates down my arm and along that inside of my arm moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle pain with resisted pronation of forearm pain with flexion and bending the wrist consistent with medial epicondylitis | O: it's hurting on the inside of my elbow when I roll over and it just wakes me up ibuprofen isn't really helping I've been doing some pottery... making a ceramic bowl and I'm gonna paint it... working on it a lot for my son's birthday it’s been hurting for about four days and it’s just not getting better no, I haven’t [injured my elbow before] sometimes I forget... having a medication twice a day I’ll just let him know that I maybe I’ll take a picture of what I have far friends tell me something about combining a protein if I eat something sweet | A: on a scale of one to ten... about a seven tried a little bit of ice at first order an A1C... evaluate other options if sugars aren’t under control walk around the neighborhood... one to two miles a day | P: history of hypertension... on ten milligrams of lisinopril checking my blood pressures regularly... one teens to one thirties taking my medications everyday... set an alarm for that lisinopril diabetes... on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day I have a sweet tooth... love to bake... make cakes and cinnamon rolls no bruising or swelling... no discoloration or lesions x-ray of my elbow... no fracture or bony abnormality order a sling for your arm... apply ice for twenty minutes three times a day take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen every six hours hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks increase metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day refer to diabetic counseling continue lisinopril at ten milligrams","The patient reports experiencing pain that radiates down their arm and extends along the inner aspect of their arm. The pain is described as moderate and there is tenderness noted at the medial epicondyle, which is the bony prominence on the inner elbow. The patient also experiences discomfort with resisted forearm rotation (pronation) and pain during flexion and bending of the wrist. These symptoms are indicative of medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer's elbow.","The patient has been experiencing pain on the inside of their elbow for the past four days. The pain wakes them up during the night and over-the-counter pain relief with ibuprofen has not been effective. The patient has been engaged in a pottery project, creating a ceramic bowl for their son's birthday, which they have been working on extensively. No previous elbow injuries have been reported. The pain persists despite forgetting to take prescribed medication twice a day. Friends have suggested the possibility of combining protein intake with sweet foods.","The healthcare professional evaluated the patient's current condition and assigned it a glucose control level of around seven out of ten. The patient had attempted to manage their blood sugars with a small amount of ice, but further options were to be considered if control wasn't improved. A recommended course of action included regular walks in the neighborhood, approximately one to two miles per day, to support blood sugar regulation.","The patient, who has a history of hypertension and is currently taking ten milligrams of lisinopril daily, is advised to continue checking their blood pressure regularly. They are also taking metformin, 500mg twice a day for diabetes, and are encouraged to take their medications every day. The patient is reminded to set an alarm for their medications and is advised to avoid baking, as they have a sweet tooth.

During the appointment, there were no signs of bruising, swelling, discoloration, or lesions. An x-ray of the patient's elbow revealed no fracture or bony abnormality. The patient is instructed to use a sling and apply ice for twenty minutes three times a day for an elbow injury. They are also prescribed ibuprofen, 600mg every six hours, and advised to hold off on pottery for a few weeks.

The patient's metformin dosage is increased to 1000mg twice a day, and they are referred to diabetic counseling. The patient is advised to continue taking lisinopril at ten milligrams daily.","S: The patient reports experiencing pain that radiates down their arm and extends along the inner aspect of their arm. The pain is described as moderate and there is tenderness noted at the medial epicondyle, which is the bony prominence on the inner elbow. The patient also experiences discomfort with resisted forearm rotation (pronation) and pain during flexion and bending of the wrist. These symptoms are indicative of medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer's elbow.
O: The patient has been experiencing pain on the inside of their elbow for the past four days. The pain wakes them up during the night and over-the-counter pain relief with ibuprofen has not been effective. The patient has been engaged in a pottery project, creating a ceramic bowl for their son's birthday, which they have been working on extensively. No previous elbow injuries have been reported. The pain persists despite forgetting to take prescribed medication twice a day. Friends have suggested the possibility of combining protein intake with sweet foods.
A: The healthcare professional evaluated the patient's current condition and assigned it a glucose control level of around seven out of ten. The patient had attempted to manage their blood sugars with a small amount of ice, but further options were to be considered if control wasn't improved. A recommended course of action included regular walks in the neighborhood, approximately one to two miles per day, to support blood sugar regulation.
P: The patient, who has a history of hypertension and is currently taking ten milligrams of lisinopril daily, is advised to continue checking their blood pressure regularly.

[patient] i see
[doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no
[patient] no

[patient] hmmm no
[doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me
[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery
[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that
[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know
[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes
[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door

- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed his diagnosis at length today. I explained that physical therapy can help with the pain, but also strengthen some of the muscles in the back. I explained that he needs to be careful while taking medications, such as an overuse of muscle relaxers if he is doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving.

"[patient] i hope i did n't hurt it again
[doctor] hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee
[patient] yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb
[doctor] how long ago did that happen
[patient] about two and a half weeks ago
[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee
[doctor] the outside of your right knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[doctor] okay
[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[doctor] okay
[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like
[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[doctor] okay when did you break your toe
[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[patient] right correct
[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye
[patient] bye","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Price is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.

MEDICAL HISTORY

He states that he has fractured his 2nd toe 3 times over the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in sales. He rides a bike for exercise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in his toes on his right foot from prior injury.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: >Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Slight edema. Slight effusion. No pain with palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full ROM. Negative Lachman's.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee lateral collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.","S: turned over my ankle. the outside of my knee. feels locked and I have to ease into walking again, pain when I rest it on my heel. ibuprofen... at night helps me settle down and sleep better.

[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[patient] used to when i lived in detroit
[doctor] oh
[patient] hockey town but not so much anymore
[doctor] no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later
[patient] thanks","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dennis Martin is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right heel pain. The onset of his pain began 10 days ago while training for a triathlon. He locates his pain to the posterior aspect of his heel, which radiates proximally into his calf. His pain is aggravated by working out and when he first gets up in the morning. If he sits for a long period, his pain will return upon standing. The patient states that he runs 10 kilometers in the morning. At lunchtime, he tries to get on a bike for about 45 minutes to an hour. In the evening, he goes to the aquatic center and swims for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The patient states that he runs 5 days per week. He adds that he alternates between a long run and a long bike ride on weekends. He currently takes one day off from his exercises. The patient states that he does not stretch at all. He denies any left leg pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right heel pain. Denies left leg pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right heel: Pain with resisted extension. Mild pain with flexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test. Severe tenderness to the Achilles tendon. Thompson test is negative, bilaterally.

RESULTS

No new imaging was obtained today

ASSESSMENT

Right Achilles tendinitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely secondary to overuse. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient was instructed to take at least 1 week off from his training to recover from this. I will provide him with a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen his right lower extremities. I have advised him to take 3 tablets of ibuprofen every 6 hours for pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an x-ray.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 to 10 days to check on his progress.",,,,,,"S:

"[doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on
[patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal
[doctor] okay how long has that wound been present
[patient] maybe about a year
[doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics
[patient] it's probably been five months
[doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on
[patient] keflex
[doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the
[patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot
[doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it
[patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired
[doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend
[patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do
[doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running
[patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten
[doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but
[patient] yes
[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes
[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me
[patient] i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend
[patient] thank you
[doctor] alright thanks","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Non-healing right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christina Cooper is a pleasant 77-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. The onset of her wound began 1 year ago with no specific injury. The patient states that it seemed like a blister and she picked at it where it then turned red. The patient was seen by her primary care physician and was prescribed Keflex. She states that the antibiotics improved her symptoms, however they did not resolve them. The patient adds that she was last on Keflex 5 months ago. She denies any pain, however she reports decreased sensation in her foot. The patient also reports increased drainage and fatigue. She states that she has been wearing her regular shoes.

The patient has type 2 diabetes with neuropathy. She states that her blood sugars are running better than they were; however, they are still in the 200's. Her last hemoglobin A1C was 10.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer and drainage.

VITALS

No fever noted. Vitals look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. I do see some yellow slough that is present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. There is no evidence of fluid collection. I do not see necrosis. No odor. I do not appreciate any bony exposure. No pain to palpation.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right foot today reveals no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine her blood supply to see if we can heal the wound. We discussed doing a debridement in office today, which she agreed to. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support. I have also prescribed the patient collagenase ointment to apply to her wound 1 time per day and cover it with a sterile dressing. I advised the patient that this should be continued until we see the ulcer decrease in size.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress.","S: 1 by 2 centimeter wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral foot... yellow slough... minimal granulation tissue... no surrounding erythema or cellulitis... no bony exposure... no odor | O: I can't get this ulcer to heal It just seemed a little blister and I picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected I went on some antibiotics [Keflex], it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away No pain but I don’t have much feeling in my foot There has been a lot more drainage and I just feel a little more tired I’ll probably be walking around at the zoo... eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do | A: It's been about a year You’ve got neuropathy Blood sugars are running better than they were but still in the two hundreds Last A1C was about ten | P: Non-healing foot ulcer No evidence of osteomyelitis Order an ABI to determine blood supply Debridement here in the office Prescribe colaganase ointment... cover with sterile dressing Get you a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area Follow-up in two weeks for re-evaluation","The patient reported a 1 by 2 centimeter wound located on the dorsal side of their lateral foot.

[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake

[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right

[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

MEDICATIONS

aspirin 81 mg daily
Brilinta 90 mg twice daily
Lipitor 80 mg daily
Toprol 50 mg daily
lisinopril 20 mg daily
metformin

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral leg swelling.

VITALS

Within normal limits

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: No carotid bruits. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left base.
- Examination: Right radial artery cath site is clean, dry, and intact without hematoma. Radial artery pulses are palpable.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Bilateral lower limb edema. Pitting 1+.

RESULTS

EKG is reviewed and demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm. Good R wave progression. Evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a STEMI.

Echocardiogram is reviewed and demonstrates a reduced ejection fraction of 35%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease that we will continue to monitor.
- Medical Treatment: She will continue aspirin 81 mg daily and Brilinta 90 mg twice daily. She will continue Lipitor 80 mg a day and Toprol 50 mg daily. I am going to refer her to cardiac rehab for education and to gain confidence to resume exercising regularly.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: A recent echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. She was able to be treated in the cath lab in a timely manner, so I think that the muscle is just stunned. Given her history. it will improve over time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that she will recover since she is compliant with her medications.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.

3. Acute heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid.
- Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe Lasix 40 mg once a day. I want to add Aldactone 12.5 mg daily. I will order lab work. We will obtain a repeat echo in approximately 2 months.

4. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Blood pressure is well controlled. She will tolerate the Aldactone well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue exercising and to be cognizant of her diet. I explained that there are healthier alternatives available to reduce the amount of preserved meats she consumes.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient received a referral to nutrition counseling to consider what other diet options might be available to her.

5. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin as prescribed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks

[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else
[patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing very well and has been compliant with all medications. A slight 3/6 ejection murmur was heard on exam, however, this is stable and has been present in the past. He is experiencing 1+ non-pitting edema, but this seems to be medication related.

- Patient Education and Counseling: Patient was advised that his stents will remain in place permanently and that they typically do not require replacement. We discussed it is common to experience dizziness when standing quickly and that this should resolve once he is adjusted to his medications. We also discussed that cardiac rehab will be beneficial in helping him become more active and confident with exercising. He was advised to watch for symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion as this would need further testing such as a stress test.
- Medical Treatment: Referral to cardiac rehab was provided. A refill for metoprolol 50 mg once a day and Crestor 40 mg once a day was also provided. He is also advised to continue aspirin daily long term as well as Brilinta for the next 6 months.

2. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: Patient's most recent creatinine levels are stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of following up with nephrology.
- Medical Treatment: He will follow up with his nephrologist, Dr. Miller.

3. Diabetes.

- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of diabetes management and how plays an important role in his coronary artery disease. He was advised that his hemoglobin A1c goal will be 6.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat hemoglobin A1c was ordered today. A dietitian referral for diabetes education was also provided. We will contact his primary care physician regarding his insulin regimen.

4. Mild depression:
- Medical Reasoning: Patient reports feeling depressed and having a hard time adjusting since having his heart attack. He mentions he is also lonely and does not have a support system.
- Medical Treatment: Referral to psychiatry was provided today.

"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime

[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much
[doctor] thank you very much","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.",S: not affecting my sleep hmmm | O: mostly when I'm typing on the keyboard is when I experience the pain. the numbness and tingling is all the time. the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse. i've been taking ibuprofen ibuprofen and seem not typing on the keyboard helps the most. positive tinel's sign in alexis what is going on is that you have a carpal tunnel syndrome. the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with | A: you do have a little bit of a less grip strength on the and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain what's happening here is that you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves | P: I sit at the keyboard all day long and recently I've been having some numbness and tingling in my hand. probably on and off for six months but over the last month or it's been a little more persistent. you do have pain on flexion and extension and when I touch the fingertips here...

Numbness and tingling sensations are persistent for Alexis. The use of ibuprofen provides some relief for the symptoms. Upon physical examination, a positive Tinel's sign was noted in Alexis' case. This finding, along with the reported symptoms and their localization to the thumb, pointer, and middle finger, is indicative of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.","The patient is exhibiting reduced grip strength, a common symptom associated with the diagnosed condition. An examination of the wrist reveals thickening in the membranes, leading to pressure and compression of the surrounding nerves.","The patient, who spends long hours at the keyboard, has been experiencing numbness and tingling in their hand for approximately six months, with increased persistence over the past month. They report pain during flexion and extension, as well as when touching their fingertips. The healthcare provider recommends wearing a night splint to help alleviate symptoms. The patient is also advised to increase their ibuprofen dosage to 600 milligrams four times a day. An outpatient test called an EMG (electromyography) will be ordered to assess nerve conduction in the wrist. Depending on the results, physical therapy or surgery may be considered to release impingement on the nerves in the wrist.

[patient] no
[doctor] no belly pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful

Right elbow pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow. Mild pain with flexion and extension but otherwise normal range of motion. There is swelling about the elbow, as well as mild ecchymosis.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Examination: Bruising noted over the right elbow.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right elbow was reviewed and demonstrates no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right elbow contusion.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient sustained an injury to his elbow when his son struck him with a lacrosse stick. His x-ray and exam findings are consistent with an elbow contusion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to avoid playing lacrosse for the next couple of weeks, just until his elbow heals. After that, he should be fine to continue playing normally.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to prescribe him ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily to help with some of the pain and swelling. He should also ice the area in 20-minute intervals 3 times per day to further reduce his symptoms.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well-controlled with dietary modifications and lisinopril.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged him to keep up with his dietary modifications.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep him on lisinopril 20 mg daily.

3. Diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well controlled at this time.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep him on metformin 500 mg and order a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate any need for medication adjustments.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Hurt it about a week ago playing lacrosse with my kids Hurts anytime I move it Tried taking Advil a couple of days but usually just forget about it Blood pressure's a little bit high today: 150/90 mmHg Family follows a Mediterranean diet, low salt intake | O: Pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow Mild pain with flexion and extension but normal range of motion Swelling and mild ecchymosis noted over the right elbow X-ray of the right elbow demonstrates no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities | A: Right elbow pain At the tip of the elbow Radiates down the forearm On 20 mg of lisinopril daily On 500 mg of metformin daily Blood sugars run between 80 to 100 when checked Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur Prescribe 800 mg ibuprofen twice daily and ice 3 times a day for 20 minutes Avoid playing lacrosse for the next couple of weeks Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension Order a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate diabetes medication adjustments | P: Patient understands and agrees with the recommended plan","The patient, while engaging in a game of lacrosse with their kids a week prior, sustained an injury to an unspecified body part.

This condition is aggravated by the use of 20 mg of lisinopril daily for hypertension and 500 mg of metformin daily for diabetes. The pain level is not severe, with only a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur detected. An assessment of the patient's blood sugar levels reveals that they run between 80-100 mg/dL.

Based on these findings, it is suspected that the patient may be experiencing elbow pain due to inflammation or injury. The use of ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory medication, is prescribed at a dosage of 800 mg twice daily, along with ice therapy for 20 minutes, three times a day to help alleviate the pain and reduce inflammation. The patient is advised to avoid playing lacrosse for a few weeks to allow the elbow to heal.

However, it is also important to consider the possibility of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, contributing to the elbow pain. To evaluate the effectiveness of the patient's current diabetes medication","The patient has been informed and has consented to the proposed treatment and follow-up plan. This includes:

1. Initiation of a specific medication regimen to manage their condition.

Right ankle pain and swelling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Hernandez is a pleasant 42-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain and swelling. The onset of his pain began yesterday after he slipped and fell on the ice while taking out the trash. He states that he was unable to ambulate at the time of injury and that a friend had to help him up. He then proceeded to ice and elevate his ankle throughout the night. His pain has since improved and he is able to bear more weight on his right ankle, however he is still limping. He denies experiencing any numbness to his right foot. In addition to ice and elevation he has been taking ibuprofen for his pain, which has provided some relief. He does not recall any other previous injury to his right ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he is very active and enjoys playing soccer. He currently plays for the community soccer league.

Vitals signs look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Mild edema
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis is present. There is swelling over the lateral malleolus. Tenderness to palpation anterolaterally in the soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot. Neurovascular intact. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds with a strong dorsalis pedis pulse. Sensation is intact to light touch.

RESULTS

3 views of the right ankle were taken today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Right ankle sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture and that he sustained a right ankle sprain. Treatment options were discussed. He was advised to keep his right lower extremity elevated, especially when seated. He will also continue to ice his right ankle. An Aircast was provided today to help stabilize his ankle. He is to also utilize crutches for the next 1 to 2 days followed by weight-bearing as tolerated. For pain control he can continue to take NSAIDs as needed. We discussed that he should see significant improvement in his symptoms over the next 2 weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and to determine his return to play date. He is advised to call the office should his symptoms change or worsen prior to his next appointment.","S: I was going out to take off the trash and I was icy... I slipped and I was on the ground.

[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well

Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] okay
[doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel

[patient] she is five and perfect
[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg
[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days

[doctor] alright any other questions
[patient] no that's it

Angela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.

RESULTS

4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Left knee pain, possible MCL strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.",S: I believe you have a MCL strain or a medial collateral ligament... strained that ligament there. | O: I hurt my knee the other day when I was running around with my niece...

Clinically, this suggests a possible diagnosis of a soft tissue injury, such as a sprain or strain, given the presence of pain, edema, and effusion, without any clear bony pathology. Further evaluation, such as an MRI or ultrasound, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the injury.","The individual undergoing treatment is advised against taking any Advil or ibuprofen due to specific medical reasons. The treatment plan focuses on alternative methods for managing pain and reducing inflammation.

Initially, acetaminophen (Tylenol) will be used for pain relief as needed. For inflammation and swelling, the healthcare provider may recommend topical treatments such as ice packs, heat therapy, or over-the-counter creams containing ingredients like menthol or capsaicin.

Regular exercise and physical activity, tailored to the individual's abilities and limitations, will be encouraged to promote healing and improve overall health. Proper nutrition and hydration are also essential components of the treatment plan.

Follow-up appointments with the healthcare provider will be scheduled to monitor progress, assess the need for adjustments to the treatment plan, and address any concerns or questions the individual may have. Regular communication with the healthcare provider is essential to ensure effective management of symptoms and optimal health outcomes.","S: The patient reports suspecting an injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) based on symptoms experienced. No further details regarding the injury, such as severity or cause, have been provided.
O: The patient, who recently injured their knee during playtime with their niece, described the pain as a throbbing discomfort, more prominent on the inner side. Initially rated as a 4 on the pain scale, the pain had worsened and was not effectively managed with Tylenol or kinesiology tape. A prescription of tramadol 50 mg twice daily and a knee immobilizer were recommended for the next week. Ice therapy was suggested for three to four sessions daily. The patient was advised against running for the following three weeks and was encouraged to contact the healthcare provider if the condition worsened.
A: The patient presented with edema and effusion in the left knee. The range of motion was within a moderate range. The patient reported pain during both flexion and extension.

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam. It has been a year since I last saw the patient.

The patient has been traveling a lot recently since things have gotten a bit better. She reports that she got her COVID-19 vaccine so she feels safer about traveling. She has been doing a lot of hiking.

She reports that she is staying active. She has continued watching her diet and she is doing well with that. The patient states that she is avoiding salty foods that she likes to eat. She has continued utilizing her medications. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in her legs.

Regarding her depression, she reports that she has been going to therapy every week for the past year. This has been really helpful for her. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The patient reports that she is still forgetting to take her blood pressure medication. She has noticed that when work gets more stressful, her blood pressure goes up. She reports that work has been going okay, but it has been a lot of long hours lately.

She endorses some nasal congestion from some of the fall allergies. She denies any other symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression. Denies suicidal or homicidal ideations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities.

VITALS REVIEWED

• Blood Pressure: Elevated.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45%. Mitral regurgitation is present.

Lipid panel: Elevated cholesterol.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with her medication and dietary modifications. Her previous year's echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as some mitral regurgitation. Her cholesterol levels were slightly elevated on her lipid panel from last year.
• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram. We will also repeat a lipid panel this year.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue with her current medications. We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily and initiate Lasix 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with weekly therapy.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications but has been inconsistent with the use of her medication. She attributes elevations in her blood pressure to increased stress.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily as noted above.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to take her lisinopril as directed. I advised her to monitor her blood pressures at home for the next week and report them to me.

Healthcare maintenance.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is due for her routine mammogram.
• Additional Testing: We will order a mammogram and have this scheduled for her.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I've been traveling a lot recently... I feel safer about traveling. I've been doing a lot of hiking. I resisted... the salty foods that I love to eat. I've been doing a really good job. I'm still forgetting to take my blood pressure medication. And I've noticed when work gets more stressful, my blood pressure goes up. I've been going every week... for the past year... that's been really helpful for me. | O: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur... 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. Echocardiogram... decreased ejection fraction of 45%. Mitral regurgitation is present. Lipid panel: Elevated cholesterol. | A: Annual exam. congestive heart failure, depression and hypertension Endorsing some nasal congestion from some of the fall pollen and allergies. | P: No, not that I've noticed Increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day... start you on some Lasix, 20 milligrams a day. Your blood pressure's high... retaining a little bit of fluid. It's been a lot of long hours, late nights... with the responsibility comes the stress. Repeat another echocardiogram... schedule for a mammogram. Can I take all my pills at the same time? You can certainly take them all at the same time... set an alarm. No, nothing that... [no feelings of wanting to harm self/others].","The patient has been traveling extensively in recent times, expressing a newfound sense of safety during their journeys. They have been actively engaging in hiking activities. The patient has made an effort to avoid salty foods, reporting a successful adherence to this change. However, they have been inconsistent with taking their blood pressure medication. The patient has acknowledged that their blood pressure levels increase when work becomes more stressful. They have been attending weekly sessions for the past year, which they have found beneficial.","During the physical examination, a grade 3/6 ejection murmur was detected, indicating some degree of obstruction or turbulence in blood flow as the heart contracts. Additionally, there was 1+ pitting edema observed in both lower extremities, a sign of fluid accumulation.

Further diagnostic testing through an echocardiogram revealed a decreased ejection fraction of 45%, suggesting a reduced ability of the heart to effectively pump blood. Mitral regurgitation was also identified, implying leakage of blood from the heart's left chamber back into the atrium during the relaxation phase.

Moreover, results from a lipid panel showed an elevated cholesterol level, which may contribute to the development or worsening of cardiovascular conditions.","During the annual exam, the patient presented with a history of congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension. They reported experiencing some nasal congestion due to fall pollen and allergies. The healthcare provider made an assessment of the patient's condition based on this information.

Clinical reasoning:
The patient's history of congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension suggests that they have complex medical needs. The presence of nasal congestion could be related to seasonal allergies or a worsening of heart failure symptoms. The healthcare provider may consider ordering tests to evaluate the patient's heart function and assess the severity of their allergies. They may also review the patient's current medications to ensure that they are being effectively managed for their heart failure, depression, and hypertension. Additionally, the healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications to help alleviate the nasal congestion. Overall, the healthcare provider will need to consider the potential interactions between the patient's various conditions and develop a comprehensive treatment plan to address their current symptoms and ongoing medical needs.","The doctor prescribed an increased dosage of lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day and added Lasix with a dosage of 20 milligrams a day due to the patient's high blood pressure and fluid retention. The patient's work schedule was demanding, causing stress, so the doctor suggested repeating an echocardiogram and scheduling a mammogram. The patient inquired if they could take all their pills at once, and the doctor permitted this, advising them to set an alarm. There was no indication of any feelings of self-harm or harm to others.","S: The patient has been traveling extensively in recent times, expressing a newfound sense of safety during their journeys.

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.

The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.

Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.

In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.

He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees.
• Neurological: Denies headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures.

Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.

Hypothyroidism.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.
• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Andrew is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. | O: it was just the repetition and the weight of the boxes. does it prevent you from doing,, your activities of daily living, walking and exercising and things that ? in terms of your hyperthyroidism, how are you doing with the synthroid ? are you doing ?

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with back pain.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: He is experiencing pain in his back that is similar to his previous kidney stone pain. His recent abdominal x-ray demonstrates what appears to be a recurrent kidney stone.
• Additional Testing: I have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.
• Medical Treatment: We will start him on Ultram 50 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to stay well hydrated and to strain his urine.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with Imitrex and is doing well at this time.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Imitrex.

Reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This is typically well-controlled with dietary modifications.
• Medical Treatment: Continue with Protonix 40 mg daily. A refill was provided.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Feeling a lot of the same pain that I had when I had kidney stones about two years ago.

O: The patient's lumbar spine was examined through an x-ray, which revealed normal findings. The healthcare professional acknowledged the patient's ongoing use of medications, specifically lisinopril and lasix, and provided no objections or concerns based on the current examination results.
A: The patient has been adhering to their treatment plan by taking their medications, maintaining a diet, and engaging in regular exercise. A systolic ejection murmur with a rating of 2 out of 6 has been detected during the examination, which is consistent with a previous finding. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin A1c level was measured at 8, indicating higher than desired blood sugar control.
P: The patient was diagnosed with decreased range of motion during flexion and extension in their right leg, but passed the straight leg raise test. The right leg had a score of 4 out of 5 on the pain scale, while the left leg scored 5 out of 5. The healthcare provider prescribed meloxicam at a dosage of 15 milligrams once daily for pain management. The patient was also referred to physical therapy for mobility exercises and rehabilitation. An MRI scan was ordered to further investigate the issue. Additionally, the patient's metformin dosage was increased to 1,000 milligrams twice daily. A repeat hemoglobin A1c test was scheduled for a few months in the future."

Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.

The patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.

Ms. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.

Regarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.

The patient denies unexplained weight gain or loss, fevers, chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena. Endorses vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Gastrointestinal: Pain to palpation of the right upper quadrant. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs.
• Musculoskeletal: Right knee shows a little effusion. Slight pain to palpation. Some decreased range of motion.

RESULTS

Autoimmune panel is within normal limits.

X-ray of the right knee demonstrates residual arthritis. No fractures noted.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems.

Acid reflux with nausea and vomiting.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning, as well as abdominal pain and bloating. She has been compliant with omeprazole and has made a few dietary modifications.
• Additional Testing: We will order an ultrasound of her right upper quadrant, as well as additional labs, to rule out biliary etiology.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 40 mg once daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Gout.
• Medical Reasoning: Her flares are well controlled on allopurinol.
• Medical Treatment: Continue allopurinol 100 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and has remained active since her last visit. Physical therapy has also been beneficial for her. Her right knee x-ray demonstrated residual arthritis but was otherwise normal.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue pilates and using the knee. She will contact me if she has any issues and we can consider further imaging or intervention at that time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",,,,,,"S:

She denies any blood in her stools recently but notes she had blood in her stool about 3 years ago and had a colonoscopy for that. She denies any black, tarry stools, heavy menstrual bleeding, unintentional weight loss, or syncope.

Ms. Diaz had a colonoscopy about 3 years ago due to blood in her stool. This showed mild diverticulitis. She denies issues since that time.

Regarding her congestive heart failure, she states she is not doing well with her salt intake. This has been more of a struggle recently as she has been traveling a lot. She has noticed some swelling in her legs but nothing too extreme.

The patient denies recent issues with kidney stones. She denies low back pain, flank pain, or blood in her urine.

Ms. Diaz notes she has had some nasal congestion but attributes this to the season changing. She gets seasonal allergies but everything else has been okay. The patient denies fever, chills, sore throat, or cough.

Hemoglobin is 8.2.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

Anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue. Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2, but she denies any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or urinary tract bleeding, as well as any abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her colonoscopy from 3 years ago demonstrated mild diverticulosis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an anemia profile for further evaluation.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her back to gastroenterology for repeat evaluation with possible endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed some lower extremity edema. Her echocardiogram from 6 months ago demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate Lasix 40 mg once daily, and continue with Toprol 50 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She should continue to limit her sodium intake. I advised her to monitor her daily weights and notify me if these start to increase.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: She as asymptomatic denies any recent flare ups.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications and proper hydration. She will contact me with any questions or concerns.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I’ve been traveling a lot... I stopped at McDonald’s and got two cheeseburgers. I could be doing better. I’ve noticed some swelling in my legs. No, I haven’t [seen blood in stools]. I did about three years ago, and I did a colonoscopy for that, but nothing since. | O: Your hemoglobin is low. No issues since [the colonoscopy showed mild diverticulosis]. No weight loss or passing out... just a bit dizzy. I get seasonal allergies, so some nasal congestion. I hear a three out of six systolic ejection murmur. Trace to one plus pitting edema in your ankles. Start you on some Lasix 40 mg once a day... continue your Toprol 50 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily. Watch your salt intake... weigh yourself every day. Call me if your weight starts to go up. Continue to watch your diet and stay hydrated... despite the diuretic. Not that I can think of. | A: We’ll send off some more labs and anemia profile... refer you back to gastroenterology for another evaluation. | P: Over the past couple of months, I've been really tired and dizzy. I've been getting tired even just walking a mile or going to work, doing things that I've done in the past every day. I had a colonoscopy three years ago for blood in my stools, but nothing since.","The patient has been traveling extensively and recently consumed two cheeseburgers from McDonald's. They report some discomfort and have noticed swelling in their legs. However, they deny experiencing any bleeding in their stools since their last colonoscopy, which was conducted three years prior due to a previous incident.","The patient's hemoglobin levels were found to be low during the examination. However, no concerning symptoms such as weight loss or fainting were reported. The patient mentioned having seasonal allergies, causing nasal congestion.

As a result, the healthcare provider prescribed Lasix 40 mg once a day, continued Toprol 50 mg daily, and lisinopril 10 mg daily. The patient was advised to monitor their salt intake, weigh themselves daily, and contact the healthcare provider if their weight increased. The patient was also instructed to maintain a healthy diet and hydration despite taking a diuretic. No other notable findings were reported during the examination.","The healthcare professional suggests ordering additional lab tests and an anemia profile for further evaluation. Based on the current assessment, it is recommended that the patient be referred back to a gastroenterologist for further examination.","Over the past couple of months, the patient has been experiencing significant fatigue and dizziness. Despite previous normal energy levels, even routine activities like walking a mile or going to work have left the patient feeling exhausted. The patient underwent a colonoscopy three years ago due to observed blood in their stools, but no further diagnostic tests have been conducted since. The patient's current symptoms warrant a thorough medical evaluation.

The healthcare provider may order various tests to investigate the cause of the patient's fatigue and dizziness. These could include blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess heart function, or an echocardiogram to evaluate heart structure and function. A hearing test or balance assessment may also be recommended, as dizziness can be a symptom of inner ear disorders.

If the results of these tests indicate an underlying medical condition, the healthcare provider will develop a treatment plan accordingly. For example, if anemia is diagnosed, iron supplements may be prescribed. If a heart condition is identified, medications to manage symptoms or improve heart function may be necessary. Inner ear disorders may require specific therapies or medications.

Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled","S: The patient has been traveling extensively and recently consumed two cheeseburgers from McDonald's.

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for and prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

The patient reports he felt something in the lower right side of his back while pushing a refrigerator up through another room. This happened about 5 days ago. The patient experiences pain while bending over. He has a history of a discectomy. He is worried that something happened. He has been taking ibuprofen, which has not been beneficial alone. With the combination of Tylenol and ibuprofen, he experiences symptomatic relief. He denies numbness and tingling in his legs, and any problems with his bladder or bowels.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

Lumbar strain.
• Medical Reasoning: He reports right-sided low back after moving a refrigerator approximately 5 days ago. X-ray of his lumbar spine is unremarkable. I do not believe this is related to his previous discectomy.
• Additional Testing: We will order a MRI of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily, as well as Ultram 50 mg every 4 hours as needed.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to be started after we get his MRI results back.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to discontinue the use of ibuprofen, but he may continue using Tylenol if he wishes.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Bryan is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy, who presents with back pain. | O: My wife made me push a refrigerator out through the other room, and when I was helping to move it, I felt something in my back on the lower side.

[doctor] that can certainly cause your blood sugar to be elevated . um , hey dragon , uh , show me the rapid strep . and you also have , uh , positive for strep . so i think we have some reasons as to why your blood sugar is so high . so my impression of you , you know , you have this hyperglycemia , which is probably related to some infections going on in your body . um , from a- a- a rapid strep standpoint we're gon na go ahead and treat you with penicillin or , i'm sorry , amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day . uh , make sure you take it all , even if you start feeling better , okay ?
[patient] for sure .
[doctor] hey dragon , order amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day for 10 days . um ... okay . and from ... , and from all- ... a positive lyme titer aspect , we should go ahead and order a western blot , just pcr to see if you have any , um , to see if it's actually acute lyme , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . um , hey dragon , order a western blot pcr for lyme . okay . all right . well we'll go ahead and , um , the nurse will come in soon and she'll set you up with these tests , okay ?
[patient] yeah . you said lyme . is that related to lyme disease ?
[doctor] yes it is , yeah .
[patient] you're certain i do n't have alpha-gal syndrome though , right ? i'm terrified of that one .

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Negative for fever, chills or unintentional weight changes.
• Musculoskeletal: Positive for right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Neck
• General Examination: Neck is supple, mild thyromegaly noted.

Respiratory
• Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
• Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.

Gastrointestinal
• Examination of Abdomen: Soft.

Musculoskeletal
• Examination: Right knee shows some erythema and insect bite with associated fluctuance. Trace edema in the right lower extremity.ß

RESULTS

Lyme titer: elevated.

Rapid strep test: positive.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for evaluation of high blood sugar.

Hyperglycemia
• Medical Reasoning: This is likely related to an inflammatory response as the patient had an elevated Lyme titer and positive rapid strep test.
• Additional Testing: We will order a western blot PCR to evaluate for Lyme disease.
• Medical Treatment: We are going to treat him with amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 10 days.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",S: My blood sugar isn't under control...they've been running in the 300's My diet hasn't changed at all...most of my sugars come from fruit I have not...I do not get up at night with reflux My knee...I just noticed it when you said it Nauseous a couple of days back...because I was sitting in the back of a car No recent weight gain or fluid retention...I prefer to sleep on my side | O: Your knee shows some erythema and insect bite with associated fluctuance Lyme titer is a little elevated...positive for strep Hyperglycemia is probably related to some infections going on in your body Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day...order a western blot PCR for Lyme | A: Thyroid's a bit enlarged here For sure...That sounds good | P: You're certain I don't have alpha-gal syndrome...inflammatory response to that,"The patient has expressed concerns about their uncontrolled blood sugar levels, with readings consistently in the 300s. They report no changes to their diet, noting that most of their sugar intake comes from fruit. The patient denies experiencing nighttime reflux and has only recently noticed discomfort in their knee. A few days prior, they experienced nausea while sitting in the back seat of a car. No recent weight gain or fluid retention have been reported, and the patient prefers to sleep on their side.","The patient's knee presentation reveals signs of inflammation, with erythema and insect bite, and there is noticeable fluid accumulation or fluctuance. Laboratory test results indicate an elevated Lyme titer, suggesting a possible Lyme disease infection. Furthermore, there is a confirmed presence of streptococcal infection. The patient's hyperglycemia could be a result of ongoing infections in the body. A course of Amoxicillin, 500 mg taken three times daily, has been prescribed. To further confirm the Lyme disease diagnosis, a Western blot and PCR test are being ordered.","The healthcare professional has observed an enlargement of the patient's thyroid gland. This finding is significant and suggests potential thyroid dysfunction. Further evaluation, such as blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels, may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and determine the appropriate clinical intervention. The healthcare professional's initial assessment is preliminary and should be followed up with more comprehensive diagnostic testing.","The patient has been assessed and the healthcare professional is confident that they do not have alpha-gal syndrome. Alpha-gal syndrome is a condition characterized by an inflammatory response to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), a sugar found in the meat of certain animals. The healthcare professional has ruled out this diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and test results.

Moving forward, the patient will be advised to continue their current diet and lifestyle habits. They will be encouraged to maintain a food diary to keep track of any potential triggers and to report any new or worsening symptoms to their healthcare provider.

Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and to address any concerns they may have. The healthcare professional may also recommend other tests or refer the patient to a specialist if necessary.

Overall, the patient can take comfort in knowing that they do not have alpha-gal syndrome, but they should remain vigilant for any new symptoms and report them to their healthcare provider promptly.","S: The patient has expressed concerns about their uncontrolled blood sugar levels, with readings consistently in the 300s.

Roger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.

The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.

His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Neck
• General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender. She has a carotid bruit on the right side. 

Respiratory
• Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. Cardiovascular
• Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Gastrointestinal
• Examination of Abdomen: Soft. There is a healed scar on the right knee from prior knee surgery. Musculoskeletal
• Examination: There is no lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Blood pressure is elevated.

EKG is normal.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I feel a little enlarged thyroid here that's not tender.

Follow-up from an emergency room visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Louis Williams is a 58-year-old male presenting for a follow-up from an emergency room visit.

The patient states that he was playing tennis on Saturday, that he was really hot and that after approximately 30 minutes he was struggling to breathe. He states that he thought he was having a heart attack at that time. His wife took him to the emergency room and at that time, he states that he had been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy. He notes that on Sunday he felt fine.

The patient reports that he has been very diligent with his medications for his congestive heart failure. He notes that he has been avoiding salt for the most part but there has been some dietary indiscretion more recently.

He is status post cataract extraction approximately 3 months ago, and notes that everything has been fine since then. He denies any vision problems at this time.

The patient had a skin cancer removed approximately 5 months ago. He reports this is well healed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorse dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Neurological: Endorses lightheadedness and dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Supple. No jugular venous distention.
• Respiratory: Fine crackles bilaterally.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Bilateral lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

ECG revealed left ventricular hypertrophy consistent with congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram demonstrates stable diminished ejection fraction.
Skin cancer pathology demonstrates clear margins.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for follow-up after emergency room visit.

ED follow-up and congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe his symptoms which led to his ED visit were due to an exacerbation of his heart failure. He admits to some dietary indiscretion, which likely resulted in fluid retention.
• Medical Treatment: I will prescribe Lasix 80 mg once a day. I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.

Status post basal cell carcinoma removal.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed. No change in treatment is necessary at this time.

Status post cataract surgery.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well. We will continue to observe, but no treatment changes are needed today.

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 48-year-old female who presents for shortness of breath. She has a history of depression, smoking and chronic back pain.

The patient reports shortness of breath with mild exercise and walking. She also notes some palpitations at times. She is not sure if it is due to her back pain or not. The patient states she has been exercising more. She continues to smoke but has decreased from two packs a day down to a couple of cigarettes daily.

Regarding her depression, the patient feels that it is well managed on Effexor.

Regarding her chronic back pain, the patient has been taking Neurontin, which she states is helping control her pain. She states she tries to get as much rest as she can. She is no longer doing yoga as she has not made it a habit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion. Endorses palpitations.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain.
• Integumentary:
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Mild wheezes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test demonstrates mild asthma and the appearance of COPD.

X-ray of the chest demonstrates flattening of the diaphragm which is consistent with COPD.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with shortness of breath with exertion. Her pulmonary function tests suggest asthma or COPD and her most recent chest x-ray and physical examination today are also consistent with COPD.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I counseled the patient on the importance of smoking cessation.
• Medical Treatment: We will start the patient on Combivent, 2 puffs twice a day. I will also prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed, and a prednisone taper pack.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: It sounds like her depression is stable, so we will not change anything at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will keep taking the Effexor. I encouraged her to practice yoga for depression relief as well as her back pain.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient says she is doing well on Neurontin with only occasional exacerbation of the pain.
• Medical Treatment: She can continue Neurontin as is. I also encouraged her to practice yoga for her back pain.

Right leg pain.

HPI:

Ms. Peterson is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right leg pain. She states she was bowling and hit her leg with the ball and fell. She developed mild bruising. She denies swelling. She has been walking very carefully. She is alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen. She has a history of atopic eczema and takes Fluocinonide topical cream for it. She has a history of colectomy following diverticulosis.

EXAM

Examination of the right leg shows significant tenderness to the lateral aspect of the right upper leg. No pain or tenderness with flexion or extension of the lower leg.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right lower extremity is normal, no fractures or dislocations.

IMPRESSION

Right leg contusion.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended Mobic 15 mg once a day. She will use ice for pain. She will follow up as needed.","S: It’s very sore I’ve been going back and forth between taking ibuprofen and Tylenol I take fluocinonide when it gets really itchy This is a normal femur… really don’t see any evidence of a fracture or any swelling, it’s essentially a normal x-ray I’m going to start you on an ant-inflammatory.

When the itching becomes bothersome, they use fluocinonide. Despite the symptoms, the patient's femur appears normal according to their x-ray, showing no signs of fracture or swelling. The healthcare provider intends to initiate treatment with an anti-inflammatory medication, specifically Mobic at a dosage of 15 milligrams, once daily.","The individual presented with a complaint of pain localized to the back area on one side. There were no observable signs of injury or swelling during physical examination. The patient mentioned having eczema, and suggested using ice to alleviate the pain.

No pain or tenderness is reported during flexion or extension of the lower leg. This assessment suggests a potential injury or inflammation localized to the lateral aspect of the upper leg, likely above the knee. Further evaluation, such as palpation and imaging, may be necessary to determine the specific cause and extent of the condition. Possible diagnoses include lateral femoral condyle contusion, lateral collateral ligament sprain, or greater trochanteric bursitis. The absence of pain or tenderness with lower leg movement helps rule out some conditions affecting the knee joint itself, such as ligament sprains or meniscal injuries.","While bowling, the individual mistakenly swung their bowling ball towards their leg instead of the lane, causing them to fall. Due to this incident, they experienced worsening symptoms of their diverticulosis, leading to a diagnosis of diverticulitis.

[doctor] all right . let's uh , let's look at your x-ray .
[doctor] hey dragon . show me the last radiograph . so this is looking at your right arm , and what i see is a proximal humerus fracture . so you kinda think of your humerus as a snow cone , and you knocked the-
[patient] the top of the snow cone ?

[doctor] . on that right shoulder . you've got uh , tenderness over your right shoulder . you've got normal pulses , and everything else is normal . any numbness or tingling in that right arm ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . um , so what we're going to have to do- the good thing about um , these kinds of fractures is generally , they will heal up without surgery . um , but we have to put you in a sling that weighs your arm down and pulls it down . so we're going to put you in a long arm cast and a sling , and then we're gon na check you in two weeks to see if those bones have realigned and if they have n't , then we're gon na have to talk about doing surgery at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm going to prescribe you some pain medicine . we'll do lortab 500- lortab 5 milligram .

[doctor] um , you can take one to two tablets every uh , six hours as needed for pain . i'll give you 20 of those .

Right upper arm pain.

HPI:

Ms. Russell is a 39-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of severe right upper arm pain. She states she was playing volleyball yesterday and fell and landed on her arm. She has been taking ibuprofen every 6 hours but it does not help. She rates her pain 9/10. She denies any numbness or tingling in her arm. She has a history of gallstones and takes Pepcid. She has a past surgical history of a lumbar fusion 6 years ago. She denies any allergies.

EXAM

Examination of the right upper extremity shows swelling and erythema of the right shoulder. Tenderness over the right shoulder. Normal pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right humerus, 2 views, obtained on today's visit show a proximal humerus fracture.

IMPRESSION

Right proximal humerus fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended we place her into a long arm cast and sling. She will follow up in 2 weeks for repeat imaging. At that point, we may need to discuss surigical options. I will prescribe Lortab, 5 mg, #20 (twenty) to take every 6 hours as needed for pain.

"[doctor] hi ms. hernandez , dr. fisher , how are you ?

[doctor] all right . so it's your right elbow ?
[patient] it's my right elbow , yes .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , ms. hernandez is a 48-year-old female here for a right elbow . so , tell me what happened .
[patient] well , i was , um , moving to a new home-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i was , um , moving boxes from the truck into the house and i lifted a box up and then i felt like this popping-
[doctor] hmm .
[patient] and this strain as i was lifting it up onto the shelf .
[doctor] okay . and when- when did this happen ?
[patient] this was just yesterday .
[doctor] all right . and have you tried anything for it ? i mean ...
[patient] i put ice on it . and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it still hurts at lot .
[doctor] okay , what makes it better or worse ?
[patient] the ice , when i have it on , is better .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but , um , as soon as , you know , i take it off then it starts throbbing and hurting again .
[doctor] all right . uh , let's review your past medical history . uh ... looks like you've got a history of anaphylaxis , is that correct ?
[patient] yes . yes , i do . yeah .
[doctor] do you take any medications for it ?
[patient] um , ep- ... just an epipen .
[doctor] just epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it . um , and what surgeries have you had before ?
[patient] yeah , so carotid . yeah-
[doctor] . yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .
all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .
so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ?
[patient] yes , it is .
[doctor] okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ?
[patient] it hurts when i do that , yeah .
[doctor] all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can .
[patient] that's about it .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] how about right over here ?
[patient] uh , no that's fine . yeah .
[doctor] okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-
it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture-
[doctor] . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain .
[patient] hmm .
[doctor] and it should get better , uh , in about , you know , in a couple of days it should be improved . and if it does n't get better , give us a call and we'll see you some time next week . okay ? so we'll give you a sling , we'll give you the motrin , i'll give you about , uh , 30 , uh , uh , 30 , uh , uh , medications for that . uh , do you have any questions ?

Right elbow pain.

HPI:

Ms. Hernandez is a 48-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right elbow pain. She states she was moving boxes from the truck into the house yesterday and felt a pop in her elbow. She has tried applying ice and taking Ibuprofen, but it does not help. She has a history of anaphylaxis and has an EpiPen. Her past surgical history is significant for neck surgery.

EXAM

Examination of the right elbow shows tenderness over the lateral epicondyle. Swelling and redness are noted. Pain with flexion and extension of the elbow. Pain over the dorsal aspect of the forearm.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right elbow shows no obvious signs of acute fracture. Mild effusion about the lateral aspect.

IMPRESSION

Right elbow lateral epicondylitis.

PLAN

I will prescribe Motrin, 800 mg to take every 6 hours. She will follow up with me as needed if she continues to have pain. All questions were answered.","S: Pain with flexion and extension of your elbow. Pain on the dorsal aspect of your forearm. There's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow.

[doctor] were you having some dizziness and some lightheadedness ?
[patient] i was very lightheaded . i- i do n't know . very lightheaded .
[doctor] okay . and have you noticed bleeding from anywhere ?
[patient] i have not . i have n't hurt myself in quite a while . maybe a slight nick from a knife while chopping some onions , but nothing more than that .
[doctor] but no blood in your stools or-
[patient] no .
[doctor] . anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and any type of weight loss or decreased appetite or night sweats ? coughs ?
[patient] uh , s- slightly decreased appetite , but i wish i had some weight loss .
[doctor] um , okay . and how about any abdominal pain ? fever , chills ?
[patient] uh , none of that .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , any nausea or vomiting ?
[patient] not really . yeah . maybe a bit of nausea .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- sitting at the back of a car , that makes me nauseous at times .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , well , how are you doing in terms of your knee replacement . i know you had that done last year . that's going okay ?
[patient] mm , it seems okay . yeah .
[doctor] okay . you're walking around without a problem ?
[patient] yup , yup . just not good enough to run yet , but everything else works just fine .
[doctor] all right .
um , and i know a few years ago , you had , had that scare with the possible lung cancer , but then they did the biopsy and , and you've been fine .
[patient] yup , yup . all good .
[doctor] turned out to be benign .
[patient] yup .
[doctor] okay . great . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . your heart is regular . your lungs sound nice and clear . you have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen . your lower extremities have no edema .
[doctor] um , all right . well , let's go ahead and look at your labs , okay ?
[patient] yup .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results .
[doctor] good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that .
[doctor] um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay .
[doctor] anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ?
[patient] it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .
[doctor] so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach .
[patient] got it . makes sense .
[doctor] hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day .
[doctor] and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ?
[patient] yup , yup . the coffee's the hard part .
[doctor] yeah . it always is . how about one , one , one eight-ounce cup a day ? okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] um , and we'll go ahead and we'll see you in a couple weeks , okay ?
[patient] sure thing .
[doctor] i'm going through , uh , i'll also order another , uh , cbc on you . hey , dragon , order a complete blood count .
[doctor] all right . the nurse will be in soon . it's , you know , settle all that . i'll see you soon .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Vincent Young is a 56-year-old male who presents today for lab review.

New found anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: His hemoglobin was 8.2, which is low for his height and weight. Endoscopy from the hospital showed gastritis which could be the source of bleeding. The endoscopy also showed a polyp and a polypectomy was performed. The pathology is still pending.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to reduce his caffeine consumption avoid NSAIDs and alcohol.
• Additional Testing: Repeat CBC was ordered.
• Medical Treatment: I prescribed Protonix 40 mg once a day for gastritis.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: You're the doctor. I don't know what it is. | O: abnormal lab findings low hemoglobin very lightheaded slightly decreased appetite none of that tenderness to the lower quadrant heart regular, lungs clear hemoglobin is 8.2 repeat CBC ordered patient agrees with the treatment plan | A: nauseous at times when sitting in the back of the car no blood in stools no abdominal pain, fever, chills, vomiting, or recent weight loss no night sweats or cough protonix 40 mg once a day reduce caffeine, avoid NSAIDs and alcohol | P: knee replacement... works just fine lung cancer... biopsy... benign gastritis and a slight polyp with biopsy pending","The patient expressed uncertainty about their symptoms and diagnosis, conveying a sense of confusion and frustration.

"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","S: I haven't been able to take the thyroid medicine, the one that you prescribed, as I'm still taking my old one, the price was a little high on the new one. They’re charging me $100 for it [Epiduo gel], I don’t know if this is because it’s Walmart, or if I should try somewhere else. Let’s try something else… Sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients… clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide. I do think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight, though. My cousin was telling me to ask you about CLA, because it’s supposed to help your metabolism. Is that to take? Chromium is just a supplement and it won’t help that much… it won’t hurt, but it also won’t help that much. Your vitamin D deficiency… you need to take one [supplement] today. Your ALT was 128… back in October was 254. This is much better. We might give you some [clindamycin topical]… apply at night to avoid sun reaction. Sensitive skin… I get rashes with different products. | O: The coupon should help, and it should only be about $3 The unithroid, with the discount code, should only be about $9 for 90 days. | A: Your cholesterol was quite high… total cholesterol 222, LDL 153 (should be <100), non-HDL 178 (should be <130). The dexamethasone test you passed, which means you don’t have Cushing’s syndrome. Two of the salivary cortisol tests were normal, one was abnormal. The weight loss study… involves a medication for diabetes treatment, weekly injections, and a stipend. BMI criteria: >30 or >27 with conditions like high cholesterol. I have a friend who might be interested, and she does have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you won’t qualify. Avoid alcohol and fatty foods, low-carb diet… low cholesterol foods. | P: Repeat levels of everything before next visit. Phexxi, which is a spermicide… apply before intercourse.","The patient has been having difficulty taking the prescribed thyroid medication due to the high cost. The new Epiduo gel, which costs $100, is currently out of reach for the patient. They are considering trying a different pharmacy or asking for a prescription of the individual ingredients, clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide. The patient's liver enzymes are expected to improve once they lose weight. A cousin suggested asking about CLA, but the doctor mentioned that it is just a supplement and its effectiveness is questionable. The patient's vitamin D deficiency requires them to take a supplement, and their ALT levels have improved significantly, from 254 in October to 128. The patient has sensitive skin and gets rashes with various products, so they may be prescribed clindamycin topical to apply at night to avoid sun reactions.","The medical team noted that a coupon would be beneficial for the patient, with the cost estimated to be approximately $3. Regarding the prescription of Unithroid, the team mentioned that after applying the discount code, the cost for a supply of 90 days would be around $9.","A friend in their 30s or older with a diagnosis of high cholesterol is being advised against joining a certain program due to additional health conditions, specifically diabetes. Alcohol and fatty foods are discouraged, and a low-carb, low-cholesterol diet is recommended instead.","The patient is instructed to repeat the same treatment regimen prior to the next visit.

"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , "" fds tendon , "" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .
[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .
[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?
[patient] i'm good , how about you ?
[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?
[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .
[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?
[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .
[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?
[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .
[doctor] yeah , i see that .
[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .
[doctor] what do you do for a living ?
[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .
[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?
[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .
[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?
[patient] uh , that's correct .
[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .
[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?
[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .
[doctor] all right , how about here ?
[patient] um , there , it's not .
[doctor] okay , not as bad ?
[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .
[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .
[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .
[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?
[patient] ow , .
[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .
[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .
[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .
[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .
[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .
[patient] so the good one is good ?
[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .
[patient] okay , all right .
[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .
[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .
[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .
[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .
[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .
[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .
[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .
[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...
[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?
[patient] uh , not at the moment .
[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .
[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?
[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .
[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .
[patient] thanks , doc .

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

"[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .
[patient] okay , thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","S: He's on finasteride currently.

[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","S: You have lost about 3, 3 and a half pounds since I saw you last in April. I had leg cramps the other day, but I thought it might was maybe just because I was cold as I had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep. I drank pickle juice and it went away. I find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg. No, it did get bad for a while I tried to take some Prilosec and stopped that other one. After I stopped taking that I went back to the stomach one, I'm doing good. Your blood sugar is a little bit high, it was 169 today but that depends on what you ate and you weren't fasting for the blood check. We often to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range. I might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement. I can put it in for County for the next 30 days, and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks. Your last A1c was 5.5 in March. Your blood sugar is a little bit high, it was 169 today... I do not think we need to do it today. | O: BMP's been 3,000 in March, and is about six- was up to 6,000 in April. Your magnesium level because sometimes you urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7. Your potassium is 3.9 it's holding steady on the torsemide. Your creatinine was 0.7 not 0.8 you're doing with kidney numbers. Your BUN may be a tiny bit elevated at 23. Your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great. We do not need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently, and we do not need any more blood work because we did that today.

She reported being interested in having her knee replaced this summer at East Metro. It was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery. | P: I see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery. We want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you don’t suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed. Before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand. We will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of June. Lastly, once we get your knee surgery, we should think about getting you a colonoscopy. We can do it here locally because you have Medicare. My husband's insurance may be running out. Might we be able to get the procedure done sooner?","The patient has experienced a weight loss of approximately 3.3 pounds since the last appointment in April. Recently, the patient encountered leg cramps which they attributed to being cold and using a ceiling fan. They found relief by consuming pickle juice instead of applying cream. The patient had previously tried taking Prilosec but stopped due to side effects, and subsequently returned to their previous medication. Their blood sugar level was measured at 169 during the latest check-up, which was not taken while fasting. The doctor noted that heart patients are often prescribed magnesium supplements to maintain optimal magnesium levels. The patient's last A1c result was 5.5 in March. The doctor suggested considering a magnesium supplement, but did not recommend initiating it during the current visit.","The patient's calcium level, which was previously 3,000 in March, had increased to approximately 6,000 in April.

The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was slightly elevated at 23. Hemoglobin levels were also within normal range, indicating no current anemia. No chest x-rays or additional blood work were necessary at this time. An electrocardiogram (EKG) before surgery could be repeated on the same day.","The patient underwent a follow-up consultation for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. During the visit, the healthcare professional made adjustments to the patient's diuretic regimen, increasing the dosage of furosemide and torsemide to 20 milligrams each, given orally daily. The patient was not currently taking potassium supplements. The healthcare professional also reported an increase in the patient's lisinopril dosage to 10 milligrams daily, which had occurred in March. The patient expressed her intent to undergo a knee replacement surgery at East Metro Hospital during the summer.

"[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.",,,,,,"S:

[patient] uh , well , i'm having more fatigue , but i do n't know if it's age or if it's just , you know , drained at the end of the day . but i still ride my bike . i ca n't go as fast as i used to . i'm still riding , and , you know , after a long bike ride , i'll sit down and then boom . i'm out , you know ?
[doctor] yeah . what's a long bike ride to you ?
[patient] uh , 20 to 30 miles .
[doctor] 20 to 30 miles on a road bike ?
[patient] yeah , road bike . i think it's a time thing . if i had more time , i would try to do my 40 miles , but i have n't done that . obviously , we're too early in the season so my typical ride is , like , 20 , 30 . in years back , i could do 40 on a good day . i can still do 20 but , you know , i'm tired and have to take a break when i get home .
[doctor] yeah , i understand .
[patient] and tyler's my buddy . he's always nice and waits for me , but i used to be able to beat him . but now , he waits for me all the time . he's older than me and it- it kills me .
[doctor] yeah , i can imagine that would upset me too .
[patient] well , the last time , you know , you found a heart thing , then . just making sure that the valve is holding out , you know ?
[doctor] right . so , when was your last stress test ?
[patient] it was september 9th , 2019 , because i'm eight years out from surgery , and back then , they said , you know , it's going to last eight years . and i'm at that year , so i just want to make sure . i asked dr. lewis for an echocardiogram to see how i'm doing .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] but it's not ... like , nothing has changed drastically since i saw you .
[doctor] okay , good . do you still go down to hopkins at all ?
[patient] no , not at all . i just get follow-ups intermittently , here . going there is just ... it's too much stress .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] one more thing , i want to make sure i do n't forget . my wife and friends tell me that when i walk , i purse my lips when i'm breathing . other doctors have said , "" did you notice your pursed lips breathing ? "" i do n't know if that's a bad habit or what .
[doctor] okay . is there any wheezing associated with that ?
[patient] no , no wheezing .
[doctor] and you're able to bike 30 miles and mostly keep up with your friend , tyler , correct ?
[patient] yeah . the only other thing i want to mention is it's not like i do routine testicular exams , but i know i have this little nodule on my right testicle .
[doctor] on the testicle or the epididymis ?
[patient] epididymis . uh , i really do n't know . i'm not super concerned . i read a little online . just wanted to ask you .
[doctor] and did you have a vasectomy ?
[patient] no . let me pull my notes out and make sure i mentioned everything i wanted to tell you . those were the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything . i'm a pretty happy guy overall , you know ? i just know you would ask those questions .
[doctor] what time are you going to sleep , and about how many hours do you sleep a night ?
[patient] um , it varies . usually , i get six to seven hours of sleep . i get out of bed some days to be at work by 7:00 , lecture , and i try to work out in the morning . i- i do n't ... i'm not ... i'm not always successful , and now what i do is i- i do make reservations twice a week for a 5:45 swim in the morning .
[doctor] okay , so you're getting six to seven hours of sleep , and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time ?
[patient] i believe i snore a little bit , but she's never said anything about me not breathing .
[doctor] okay . so , you're currently taking vitamin d3 , around 5000 units on sundays , and two thous ... or 50,000 units on sundays , excuse me , and 2000s on the other six days , and then clindamycin prior to dental procedures , correct ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] have you had a covid-19 shot yet ?
[patient] i've received both . my first dose on january 15th , '21 and my second on february 5th , '21 .
[doctor] good . if you'd hop up here on the table , we're just going to do a physical exam .
[doctor] well , mr. walker , overall you're doing well . i'm going to order an echocardiogram and a stress test . i also recommend that you follow up with cardiology , i think dr. vincent sanchez would be a great fit for you .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] also your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156 . now this could be related to your liver but most likely related to your bone health . we're going to check a few labs today .
[patient] you're going to have them done today ?
[doctor] yes , sir , and we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off then we'll give you a call .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] now as far as your breathing , i observed the pursed lip breathing and your exhalation is low . i think you should do a pulmonary function test to further evaluate , and i'll order that as well .
[doctor] now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology , and we will place that referral today , also .
[patient] sounds like i'm going to be busy getting this all checked out .
[doctor] yes , sir . now you are due for your mmr and i'm recommend you get the shingles vaccine as well . you have completed your covid-19 , so that's good .
[doctor] now i'm going to have , uh ... have you return in about a year for your wellness visit . we'll see you back sooner if needed after i review all those labs and those other studies .
[doctor] do you have any other questions for me ?
[patient] no , doc . i think you covered it all .
[doctor] great . okay , the nurse will , uh , be back in a minute to give you mmr today , and the front desk will line up a time to do the shingles vaccine next month .
[patient] thanks , doc . have a great day .
[doctor] all right , i used my general physical exam template for respiratory notate : pursed lip breathing , low exhalation phase , clear to oscillation , no wheezing . uh , genitalia notate : right testicle with two to three millimeters palpable nodule does not feel as if it will ... does not feel as if with the epididymis or variococele ; left testicle , normal ; no hernia . all other portions of the physical exam are normal default .
[doctor] assessment history of the aortic aneurysm repair : the patient underwent and aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1/20/2013 . he is doing well overall and currently asymptomatic . he is currently not seen by cardiology routinely . suggest the following up and suggested vincent sanchez as his physician . we will perform an echocardiogram , eh , slash , stress test .

Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.

Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.

Mr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.

Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy.

His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days).

From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

[patient] none of that .

[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .
[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?
[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?
[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .

[patient] nope .

[patient] yup .
[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?
[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .
[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .
[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?
[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .
[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .
[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?
[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .
[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?
[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .
[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?
[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .
[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?
[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .
[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?
[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .
[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?
[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .
[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .
[patient] what would cause that ?
[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .
[patient] that's good .
[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .
[patient] what's that ?
[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .
[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?
[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .
[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?
[doctor] correct .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .
[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?
[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .
[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?
[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .
[patient] so what do i need to do ?
[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .
[patient] okay . and then what ?
[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .
[patient] which medications ?
[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?
[patient] about 18 months .
[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .
[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?
[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .
[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .
[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .
[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?
[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .
[patient] okay . and then what happens ?
[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .
[patient] and when should i see you again ?
[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .
[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?
[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .
[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .
[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .
[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .
[doctor] thank you , mr. allen .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return to clinic in 4 weeks.","S: I had an abdominal CT on 1/23/2020. Impression is a normal CT of the abdomen. I've been having this pain here in my stomach, around here. [...] In the area of your mid abdomen, just below the belly button? [Patient] Correct. I've never had any surgery. [...] Your gallbladder, appendix, all those are still intact? [Patient] Yup. | O: Here for chronic abdominal pain. The problem is I'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea. The hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged. Crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity. It may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives. Refrain from drinking any alcohol. Let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks. | A: The pain is there all the time? [...] It's a nagging feeling and it just depends. Sometimes it bothers me, sometimes it doesn't. [...] More recently in the past couple months, at least with the constipation and diarrhea. When you're constipated, do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard? [...] I usually don't go, but when I do, it's hard. [...] About three to four times a week. If I eat pasta with a creamy sauce, I'm probably gonna have diarrhea. [...] It's usually just one time and it's over. My weight has been stable, although I could stand to lose about 25 pounds. My sister does have problems with her stomach too. She has irritable bowel syndrome and that is what I always thought I had even though I've never been diagnosed with it. I've never had a colonoscopy. I thought that happens when you turn 50. They said I had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes, but we would recheck them in about six months. [...] The ALT and the AST were elevated. | P: Start a fiber supplement that should help with that. [...] Increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day. [...] Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea. We should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs. [...] Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.","The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan on January 23, 2020, which revealed normal findings. However, the patient has been experiencing stomach pain located in the mid-abdominal region, below the belly button. The patient has not undergone any surgeries, including gallbladder or appendix removal.","The patient presented with chronic abdominal pain, alternating between constipation and explosive diarrhea. A physical examination revealed hepatomegaly, indicative of an enlarged liver. The patient is currently taking Crestor, a medication known to cause liver toxicity. It is recommended to explore alternative treatment options due to the liver concerns. The patient was advised to abstain from alcohol consumption. An appointment was scheduled for a follow-up visit in four weeks.","The patient experiences persistent, intermittent abdominal pain and has noticed an increase in symptoms, including constipation with hard stools and diarrhea, particularly after consuming pasta with creamy sauces. The frequency of bowel movements is about three to four times a week. The patient suspects having Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) based on family history but has never been diagnosed or undergone a colonoscopy. Recent blood work revealed slightly elevated liver enzymes, specifically ALT and AST, which will be rechecked in six months. Clinical reasoning suggests that the patient may have IBS with constipation and diarrhea components, as well as potential liver involvement that warrants further investigation.","The patient is advised to begin taking a fiber supplement to aid with their digestive issues. They should also aim to drink at least 48 ounces of water each day. To prevent diarrhea episodes, they are encouraged to avoid certain trigger foods.

"[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .
[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .
[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .
[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?
[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .
[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?
[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .
[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?
[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .
[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?
[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .
[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?
[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .
[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
[patient] mother's .
[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
[patient] i own an auto repair shop .
[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .
[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .
[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
[patient] okay , that's fine .
[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .

I reviewed the dermatologist’s photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDE’s of mole surveillance. After discussing the procedure, risks, expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.","S: On the inferior back: 1 cm shave biopsy site with no residual pigmentation; no intrinsic or satellite lesions. No axillary, cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Soft, nontender lymph node in the groin (right side noted in pathology). Clark level 4, Breslow thickness 0.7 mm. Radial growth phase present; no vertical growth, ulceration, or lymphatic invasion. Peripheral margin positive, deep margin negative; stage 1. Recommended ultrasound of the groin lymph node to rule out metastatic disease. Primary closure preferred, but skin graft may be needed. | O: Her dermatologist referred her after biopsying a 0.7 millimeter lesion on her inferior back, which was diagnosed as melanoma. The lesion was noticed by her mother during a visit last month. She had the biopsy on April 10th due to family history of melanoma (mother and maternal aunt). Mother and maternal aunt both had melanoma. If ultrasound is normal, wide local excision with 1-2 cm margin is planned. Dermatologist’s photo showed an asymmetric black/brown nevus with irregular border. Follow-up with dermatologist for ongoing surveillance is critical. | A: Sophia Jackson is a 57-year-old female here for a surgical consult for melanoma of the inferior back. She denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports annual mole checks by her primary care provider. Maternal grandfather had pancreatic cancer; no family history of breast or ovarian cancers. | P: Owns an auto repair shop. Current smoker since teens, actively trying to quit. No reported medical conditions; allergic to Augmentin. Prior surgeries: cholecystectomy and appendectomy. Shave biopsy of inferior back: malignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading. Emphasized sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and ABCDE mole surveillance. Patient understands risks/benefits and consents to proceed.","The patient underwent surgical procedures for the removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) and appendix (appendectomy). Additionally, a shave biopsy was performed on an inferior back lesion, which was diagnosed as malignant melanoma, a type of invasive and superficial spreading skin cancer. The patient was advised to practice sun avoidance, perform regular skin self-examinations, and adhere to the ABCDE mole surveillance method to monitor for any signs of new or changing moles. The patient was informed of the risks, benefits, and potential consequences of these procedures and consented to proceed.","The patient was referred to a dermatologist following the diagnosis of a 0.7 millimeter melanoma on her inferior back. The lesion was discovered by her mother during a visit last month, and given the family history of melanoma, the patient underwent biopsy on April 10th. Both the patient's mother and maternal aunt have been diagnosed with melanoma. If the results of the upcoming ultrasound are normal, a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin is planned. The dermatologist's examination revealed an asymmetric black/brown nevus with an irregular border.

She reported no history of atypical moles and underwent regular mole checks by her primary care provider. Her family history was significant for a maternal grandfather with pancreatic cancer, but there was no reported history of breast or ovarian cancers. The assessment suggests that Sophia's melanoma may not have been detected due to her diligent mole checks by her primary care provider. However, her family history of pancreatic cancer raises the possibility of an underlying genetic predisposition, which should be further evaluated. The clinical reasoning involves considering the possibility of a genetic predisposition to cancer, given the presence of a family history, while also acknowledging the importance of regular mole checks in early detection and treatment of melanoma.","The auto repair shop owner, a long-time smoker since his teenage years, is currently making efforts to quit.

"[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .

[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Integumentary
Skin is in tact.

Musculoskeletal
Extremities: No bilateral ankle edema or calf tenderness.
Examination of gait: Heel-walk and toe-walk are intact.
Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Neurological
Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","S: allergic to percocet, vicodin and regulin. | O: range of motion is decreased in hip with pain in the groin and internal and external rotation. mr arthrogram [...] show high grade condromalacia [...] subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation. | A: in the groin area. rate the pain to range from two through seven out of 10. heel walk and toe walk are intact. resisted hip flection causes pain in the groin region. | P: this has been going on since february 2020. it hurts when i pivot it catches and i almost fall. i've lost 110 pounds.

Right knee pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of diabetes. She has been doing pretty good with her diet. She states that she forgets to check her sugars quite a bit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Some swelling present.
- Palpation: Some pain to palpation on the medial aspect of the right knee, and a little bit of pain on the lateral aspect of the right knee.
- Range of Motion: Limited range of motion as well as pain on both flexion and extension of the knee.
- Special Testing:
McMurray's Test: Negative.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee pain.
- Medical Reasoning: I am concerned about a torn MCL due to pain on ambulation and trouble with weightbearing, as well as the pop she heard.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today including bracing, anti-inflammatories, and icing. - Medical Treatment: I am going to put her in a straight leg brace and I will prescribe some Mobic. She can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want her to ice her knee once an hour for about 15 minutes.
- Additional Testing: I am also going to send her out for an MRI.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that her type 2 diabetes are well-managed.
- Medical Treatment: I am also going to get a refill on the metformin that she has been taking 500 mg.
- Additional Testing: We are going to recheck her hemoglobin A1c.

"[doctor] alright you can go ahead
[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so
[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better
[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started
[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of
[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that
[doctor] no nothing at all
[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that
[doctor] no
[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before
[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help
[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
[doctor] alright
[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
[doctor] no numbness or tingling
[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
[doctor] okay
[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
[doctor] yeah
[patient] acromioclavicular joints
[doctor] yeah yeah
[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
[doctor] yes thank you yep
[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
[doctor] i have n't
[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days
[doctor] okay alright thank you
[patient] bye
[doctor] okay bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.

The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.","S: I’ve been doing a lot of work in my basement and I even put in a new ceiling.

Emergency department follow up.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of hypertension.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Bumex 2 mg once daily, Cozaar 100 mg daily, and Norvasc 5 mg once daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Genitourinary: Reports urinary incontinence in the setting of diuretic medication.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/72 mmHg
Temperature: 98.7 degrees F
Heart Rate: 72 bpm
Oxygen Saturation: 96%

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake. She could try keeping a food diary, as previously discussed, to log her diet and associated blood pressure readings. I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

3. Kidney disease.
- Medical Treatment: Labs will be ordered to assess her response to new medications.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out
[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand
[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left
[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it

[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that
[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips
[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side
[patient] yeah same thing
[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.
Neurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

[patient] splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound
[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them
[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay
[doctor] okay that sounds good
[patient] alright
[doctor] alright
[patient] my nurse will be in with those those orders
[doctor] alright thank you
[patient] alright thanks
[doctor] bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hepatitis C.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today following a positive result in a hepatitis C antibody test. He was sent to obtain the hepatitis C antibody test as part of a routine physical. He states he is anxious with the results and denies he has ever been diagnosed with hepatitis C. The patient admits to intravenous drug use in the past; however, he notes it has been longer than 15 years since his last usage. He also reports a history of heavy alcohol use. He continues to drink a beer on occasion. The patient currently smokes 1 to 2 cigarettes per day. He notes he used to smoke more and is having difficulty with complete cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any significant past medical history.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is married with children. He reports history of IV drug use 15 years ago. He currently drinks beer occasionally. The patient reports smoking 1 to 2 cigarettes per day.

FAMILY HISTORY

He reports a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression.

MEDICATIONS

Patient denies taking any current medications.

RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
GI/GU: Abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds are present.
SKIN: No jaundice.

RESULTS

The HCV antibody test was reviewed today and is positive.

Liver panel revealed an elevated AST at 39 U/L. The ALT, albumin, and total bilirubin were all within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT

Hepatitis C.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's laboratory findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regard to his current symptoms. His initial labs were consistent with a hepatitis C diagnosis. I have recommended that we confirm the diagnosis with additional blood work including checking his hepatitis C RNA and HCV genotype. I have also recommended that we obtain an ultrasound elastography to evaluate for fibrosis of the liver.

The patient is married with children and is concerned about their hepatitis C status. I advised the patient that his family should be screened and we will assist him with setting appointments with their primary care physician.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 3 weeks to review his results and discuss further treatment.",S: I've really surprised because I've been feeling fine... came back positive. I used to party a lot and even did use IV drugs but I have been clean for over fifteen years. I still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as I used to. I do smoke I smoke about one to two cigarettes per day... having a hard time kicking those less too. Hepatitis C... most patients don’t see symptoms until years later. I hmmm I do have a wife and kids should I be worried about them? We can start with the same screening... set up those appointments with your family doctor and we can just see you back in three weeks. | O: No jaundice... regular rhythm rate... lungs are clear... abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly. HCV antibody test was positive... elevated AST at thirty nine but your ALT albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits. | A: Confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking your HCV RNA and your HCV genotype... determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis... ultrasound elastography. | P: Hepatitis C. High blood pressure diabetes and depression.,"The patient was taken aback upon receiving a positive Hepatitis C diagnosis, despite feeling well and leading a relatively healthier lifestyle than before. Previously, the patient had a history of partying and IV drug use, but had been clean for over fifteen years. Although no longer consuming alcohol in excess, they continued to smoke about one to two cigarettes daily and found it challenging to quit. Hepatitis C often presents no symptoms until years have passed, leading the patient to wonder if their family was at risk. It was recommended that they and their loved ones undergo screening appointments with their family doctor, and the patient was scheduled to return in three weeks for a follow-up visit.","During the physical examination, no signs of jaundice were observed. The patient's heart rhythm was regular, and their lungs were clear. An abdominal examination revealed a soft belly with no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory test results showed a positive HCV antibody, indicating the presence of a hepatitis C infection. However, the patient's liver function tests, specifically AST, were elevated at thirty-nine units per liter. Despite this, their ALT, albumin, and total bilirubin levels were all within normal limits.","The healthcare professional suggested confirming the diagnosis of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection through additional blood tests. These tests include determining the HCV RNA level and HCV genotype. The healthcare professional aims to assess the severity of the liver disease caused by HCV, and for this purpose, they plan to conduct a fibrosis test. An ultrasound elastography will be used to measure the stiffness of the liver tissue, which is an indicator of fibrosis.","For an individual diagnosed with Hepatitis C, co-existing conditions of high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression require a comprehensive treatment and follow-up plan.

The Hepatitis C treatment typically includes antiviral medications, such as Harvoni or Sovaldi, which are taken daily for a specified duration. These medications work by inhibiting the replication of the Hepatitis C virus in the liver. The treatment may also involve additional therapies like ribavirin and interferon to boost the effectiveness of the antiviral drugs.

During the Hepatitis C treatment, close monitoring of liver function tests is essential to assess the response to the therapy and identify any potential side effects. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and blood pressure is also necessary for individuals with diabetes and high blood pressure, respectively.

Depression, if present, should be addressed concurrently with the Hepatitis C treatment. Antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of both may be recommended based on the severity and individual response.

Following the completion of Hepatitis C treatment, continued monitoring of liver function tests is necessary to ensure the virus remains suppressed. Regular check","S: The patient was taken aback upon receiving a positive Hepatitis C diagnosis, despite feeling well and leading a relatively healthier lifestyle than before.

[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis

[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease

[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

- Patient Education and Counseling: I discussed the diagnosis with the patient today. I explained that her headaches may be caused by tension around the muscles around her neck and shoulders. I advised her that her symptoms do not appear related to signs of a stroke or brain bleeding. Questions were asked and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue to take Tylenol for the pain. Prescription for Flexeril 5 mg 3 times a day is provided as well.

2. Diabetes mellitus.
- Medical Reasoning: Due to her headaches, she has been inconsistent with her exercise and checking her blood sugar.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We also discussed the importance of keeping a watchful eye on her blood sugar levels.
- Medical Treatment: She will continue taking metformin 500 mg daily. Order for hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and CMP provided today. She will check her blood sugar daily and will bring that information in on her next visit.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.","S: Prescribed 21 mg nicotine patch... change location daily to avoid skin irritation. Follow-up in two weeks to reevaluate patch dosage and discuss triggers. Maintain type two diabetes with diet/exercise... order hemoglobin A1c for next visit. Continue allopurinol for gout... avoid uric acid-exacerbating foods. Physical exam: clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur, no carotid bruits. Vitals: BP 128/88, HR 68, oxygen saturation 98%. | O: History of gout and type two diabetes. Chosen next Monday (birthday) as quit date. Patient agrees to plan, no questions. | A: I'm doing really good. I'm here I'm just ready to quit smoking and but I've been having quite a hard time with it. Motivated because I am about to be a father any day... be there for my daughter growing up. Consider using a smoking cessation aid... friends mentioned the patch had success. | P: Started in high school, smoking here and there with friends or at parties... up to a pack and a half a day. Tried to quit before by going cold turkey... relapsed due to work stress. Stress can often be a trigger for smoking... started learning meditation and joined the gym. Monitor stress levels, especially around new fatherhood... continue gym routine and meditation.

[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office
[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile

However, the Lachman, anterior and posterior drawer, and McMurray tests were all found to be negative in both legs. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing patellofemoral pain or instability, possibly due to an underlying issue with the patellar tracking or alignment. The negative results of the other tests indicate that there is no evidence of ligamentous laxity or knee instability.

However, due to knee pain, they have been avoiding longer distances. The pain, described as an ache, worsens towards the end of the day and after prolonged periods of being on their feet. The patient manages the symptoms with ice and ibuprofen, and has discussed the issue with Dr. Wood over the years. There is no known family history of arthritis or immune diseases.
O: During the physical examination, no signs of redness or swelling were observed around the knee. A small amount of effusion was detected, and the area was tender to palpation on the lateral side. The patient's blood pressure was measured at 120/60 mmHg, heart rate was 58 beats per minute, and respirations were recorded at 14 per minute. The knee joint spaces were maintained, with no indications of fracture or arthritis. The patient was prescribed two Tylenol 500 mg and two ibuprofen 200 mg tablets to be taken three times a day. Physical therapy was recommended for strengthening the lower extremities, and running was prohibited for a period of two weeks.
A: The individual presents with pain localized to the right knee. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the cause of the pain is a knee sprain due to overuse. Given this diagnosis, it is recommended that the individual avoids lifting heavy weights and performing exercises such as squats at the gym to allow the knee to rest and heal properly.
P: The individual is encouraged to begin with the suggested physical therapy exercises. A first appointment is advised to be scheduled. In two weeks, a follow-up will be arranged to evaluate progress and add more activities to the regimen."

[patient] i do n't hear the question but i'm assuming that you when you say batcher so when i start talking about my dog and my three cats and all that those sort of things are not going to be included in the in the note
[doctor] right i want you you can talk about those things yes
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you feeling today how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing pretty good depressed
[doctor] little depressed i can understand it's a lot to take on is n't it
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay okay so lem me ask you some questions so what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted you your doctor to do the tests
[patient] i was having severe pain and bleeding
[doctor] okay now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with urination
[patient] no vomiting but constipation and weight loss
[doctor] okay yeah that's understandable so do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant
[patient] i'm sorry i did n't hear that part
[doctor] do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant
[patient] no to either one of those
[doctor] okay so and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause
[patient] thirteen for my period and twenty eighth for menopause
[doctor] okay do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy
[patient] no
[doctor] okay any history of endometriosis
[patient] any history of what
[doctor] endometriosis
[patient] no
[doctor] okay how about any family history of any gynecological cancers
[patient] i was adopted
[doctor] okay okay so i'm just gon na do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright okay so i do feel the mass on the where to go here okay
[patient] i did n't know you're gon na play a doctor today
[doctor] i did okay okay so i do feel the mass on the left side but everything else looks good and on abdominal exam there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant no rebounding or guarding on vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or
[patient] am i gon na die
[doctor] well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay
[patient] alright alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

New patient evaluation of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient was adopted and has no knowledge of any family history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports unintentional weight loss
Gastrointestinal: Reports abdominal pain and constipation. Denies vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports abnormal vaginal bleeding. Denies urinary issues.
Psychiatric: Reports depression

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.

Pelvic
- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Ovarian cancer.
- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",,,,,,"S:

[doctor] alright were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot
[doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then
[patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen
[doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen
[patient] this happened about couple days ago
[doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all
[patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling
[patient] no no numbness
[doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation
[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot
[doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out
[patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep
[doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah
[patient] that scares me
[doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery
[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc
[doctor] i know
[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[doctor] so it's actually
[patient] have to be in the hospital
[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[patient] i'm right handed
[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[patient] i mean
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[patient] i suppose so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] thank you
[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] good
[doctor] thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.

The patient has a history of a left leg injury.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.","S: I was playing tennis and I was trying to volley the ball... I got in front of another player and ended up falling on top of my foot. I quickly twisted myself around her because I was trying to catch myself but I started to feel some pain in my foot. I had to stop... I had to be held from the field because I couldn't put weight on my foot. I wrapped it... iced it last night and kept it up on a pillow... took some ibuprofen. No, I injured my other foot before not this foot. No numbness... I can still feel my foot. Your foot is probably your dominant one... you won't be able to drive... need somebody to take you home. | O: Foot pain consistent with a Lisfranc fracture... fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot. I will be ordering an MRI to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments. | A: I am going to recommend surgery... place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws... prevent further complications. Day surgery... go home the same day... cast and crutches... six to eight weeks... gradually walking on your foot. Do I have to do the surgery?... I hate that word surgery doc... how long is the procedure usually too? Out for the rest of the season... physical therapy... risks include bleeding, loss of sensation, nerve damage... chronic pain. Follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week... physical therapy to strengthen the muscles. | P: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot... associated swelling... tenderness to palpation of the midfoot... positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals... warm to touch. Subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases... presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.","The patient was playing tennis and attempting to volley a ball when they fell on top of their foot while in front of another player. In an attempt to catch themselves, they twisted their foot, resulting in pain and an inability to put weight on it. The patient required assistance in leaving the field and wrapped, iced, and elevated the foot at home. They reported no previous injury to this foot, no numbness, and continued to feel sensation in it. Given the dominance of the foot for walking and driving, the patient expressed concern about their mobility and required assistance with transportation.","The patient presented with foot pain indicative of a Lisfranc fracture. Specifically, there was an identified fracture in one of their second metatarsal bones, located near the top of the foot.

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.

VITALS

Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.","S: sudden onset of pain in my back radiated almost down to my groin never had that before father's had them in the past denies any blood in urine tenderness on the right side | O: push fluids... pass the stone | A: CT scan... showed a stone measuring 0.5 centimeters located in the proximal ureter continue to strain urine... until the stone passes urinalysis and urine culture... rule out infection lithotripsy... break up the stone vitals look good... no fever, blood pressure and heart rate are fine | P: no evidence of hydronephrosis prescribe oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain follow up in about one to two weeks","The patient reportedly experienced a sudden onset of back pain that radiated almost down to their groin, which is a new symptom for them. They mentioned having a family history of similar symptoms, but denied any presence of blood in their urine. The patient also noted tenderness on the right side of their back.","The patient underwent a physical examination during which it was noted that they were experiencing symptoms of passing a kidney stone. No abnormalities were found during the examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, or neurological system. However, the patient reported frequent urination with passing small amounts of urine, accompanied by pain in the lower back and side.

Subsequently, the patient underwent various diagnostic tests. The results of a urinalysis showed no signs of infection or abnormalities. However, an ultrasound scan revealed the presence of a kidney stone in the patient's right kidney. The healthcare provider advised the patient to increase their fluid intake to help pass the stone more easily. The provider also prescribed pain medication to help manage the discomfort. The patient was monitored closely for any signs of complications and was advised to return for follow-up appointments as needed.","The patient underwent a CT scan which revealed a 0.5 centimeter stone located in the proximal ureter. The stone was causing obstruction and the patient continued to experience straining during urination. A urinalysis and urine culture were performed to rule out a urinary tract infection. The results of these tests came back negative, indicating that there was no infection present. Given the size of the stone and the absence of infection, lithotripsy was considered as an appropriate treatment option to break up the stone. The patient's vitals, including temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate, were found to be within normal limits.","The patient will not require any intervention for hydronephrosis based on current assessment. For pain management, they will be prescribed oxycodone at a dosage of 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for approximately one to two weeks to assess the effectiveness of the pain medication and any potential need for further treatment.","S: The patient reportedly experienced a sudden onset of back pain that radiated almost down to their groin, which is a new symptom for them.

P: The patient will not require any intervention for hydronephrosis based on current assessment. For pain management, they will be prescribed oxycodone at a dosage of 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for approximately one to two weeks to assess the effectiveness of the pain medication and any potential need for further treatment."
"[doctor] hi jeremy how are you

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.",S: It's been there gosh it's six or eight weeks and it's just not going away... maybe even gotten a little worse. | O: Right foot ulcer that's been there for a couple of weeks No pain at all Last hemoglobin A1c was above nine No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses | A: Diabetic... on some insulin... sugars been running... a little higher than normal Initially... stepped on a nail or there was some other work... led to anything No fever or chills... tension headaches pretty often Occasionally... numbness and tingling in feet... colder weather Former smoker... two packs a day for twenty plus years... stopped four years ago No pain in calves when walking... no shortness of breath Continue with aspirin... help with blood supply Diabetes... unstable... need to get better controlled... impacts wound healing Coronary artery disease... statin... cardiologist for medical clearance | P: Two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion... lateral foot near the fifth metatarsal... no cellulitis... granulation tissue and slight purulent discharge Nonhealing ulcer of your foot... need to do some studies... blood supply to heal this foot wound Vascular surgeon's office... stent to one of your arteries... bypass surgery... improve blood supply Arterial ultrasound of lower extremities... podiatry consult... improve wound care,"The patient has been experiencing the symptom for approximately six to eight weeks with no improvement, and it may have worsened.","The patient presented with a right foot ulcer that had persisted for several weeks. Despite the presence of this wound, the patient reported no pain at all. The most recent hemoglobin A1c test result was above 9%, indicating poor blood sugar control. Furthermore, upon physical examination, no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses were detected. These findings suggest advanced peripheral arterial disease and potential diabetic neuropathy contributing to the foot ulcer and lack of pain sensation.","A diabetic individual is currently undergoing treatment with insulin due to elevated blood sugar levels. The cause of this spike remains unclear, with no reported injury or infection, such as stepping on a nail or contracting a fever or chills. The patient experiences frequent tension headaches and occasional numbness and tingling sensations in their feet, which are exacerbated by colder weather.

The patient has a history of smoking, having consumed two packs a day for over twenty years, but has quit four years ago. There are no reported symptoms of pain in the calves while walking or shortness of breath.

Given the instability of the patient's diabetes and its impact on wound healing, it is crucial to improve sugar control. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and is prescribed a statin. A cardiologist's medical clearance is required before continuing with aspirin therapy to help maintain optimal blood flow.","A two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion is present near the fifth metatarsal on an individual's lateral foot. The ulcer does not exhibit signs of cellulitis but does have granulation tissue and slight purulent discharge. Due to the non-healing nature of the foot wound, further studies are required to assess the blood supply and promote healing.

The patient is advised to visit a vascular surgeon for evaluation. Potential interventions may include a stent in one of their arteries or bypass surgery to enhance blood flow and improve the chances of the wound healing effectively.

Additionally, an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities is recommended to assess the overall vascular health of the legs. A consult with a podiatrist is also suggested to enhance the quality of wound care and facilitate the healing process.","S: The patient has been experiencing the symptom for approximately six to eight weeks with no improvement, and it may have worsened.

[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.

For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.
Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria

VITALS

Vitals are normal.
Blood pressure is normal.
Heart rate is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

[patient] no okay so i'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad but then otherwise just use the t gel
[doctor] yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo
[patient] alright
[doctor] okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner

Right foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Reyes is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He sustained an injury yesterday when he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot while doing yard work. He was able to get up and continue working after the injury. He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.

The patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.

The patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of left ankle surgery.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.
Neurological: Reports right foot numbness.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.

I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.

The patient wishes to think over his options before proceeding with the operation.","S: Right foot pain. Dropped a landscape brick on your foot yesterday while doing yard work. Eleven out of ten. No I feel taking the medicine. What about putting in a cast can I just stay in the cast? If the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am I going to get my MRI? We'll get you your MRI this afternoon. | O: Bruising on the bottom and top part of the foot... associated swelling... tenderness to palpation for midfoot... strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse... capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds. Dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments. | A: The whole foot is numb... been for a long time. Lisfranc fracture... fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot. You're most likely going to need surgery... plates and screws... outpatient surgery... same day... non-weight-bearing for six to eight weeks... cast and crutches. Order an MRI just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments. If we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing... losing the arch in your foot... developing arthritis. | P: It's a little sore today but I hurt my foot before... sometimes it'll give me trouble, feels a little sore, swells up at times. Twenty years ago I broke my ankle... had to put in a cast... my other ankle too is sore sometimes and I've had surgery for that too. I kept working... it's got swollen... my doctor told me I had to go see you.","The patient is currently experiencing severe pain in their right foot. The injury occurred the previous day during yard work when a landscape brick was dropped onto the foot. The pain is described as an eleven out of ten intensity. The patient is not finding relief from the medication they are taking. They have expressed interest in having a cast applied to the foot, but are unsure if that will be an option. The patient has inquired about the timing of their upcoming surgery and when they will be able to undergo an MRI. The healthcare provider has assured them that they will be able to get the MRI that afternoon.","The patient presented with noticeable bruising on both the bottom and top parts of their foot. There was also observed swelling in the midfoot region. Upon palpation, tenderness was noted in the midfoot area. The dorsalis pedis pulse was strong and bounding. Capillary refill in the affected area was brisk, taking less than three seconds. Additionally, there was dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases. Presence of bony fragments was also noted.","The patient is experiencing long-term numbness in their entire foot. It is suspected that they have sustained a Lisfranc fracture, specifically to the second metatarsal bone and the top of their foot. Surgery is recommended for treatment, which will involve the use of plates and screws in an outpatient setting. The patient can expect to be non-weight-bearing for six to eight weeks following the procedure, with the use of a cast and crutches. An MRI has been ordered to evaluate any potential damage to the ligaments. If there are issues with bone alignment or ligament healing, there is a risk of losing the arch in the foot and developing arthritis.","The patient, who has a history of ankle injuries including a broken ankle twenty years ago that required casting and more recent surgery on the other ankle, presents with recurring foot pain and swelling. Despite the discomfort, they have continued to work. The patient's doctor referred them to see a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.","S: The patient is currently experiencing severe pain in their right foot.

[patient] no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens
[doctor] okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally
[patient] i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really
[doctor] okay good
[patient] never even though anything was going on
[doctor] okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching
[patient] well no uh it's just her face
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and and you know wait a minute i i did make a video so you can see just in case it does n't do it during the visit
[doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome
[patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing
[doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger
[patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that
[doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills
[patient] no
[doctor] okay coughing headache
[patient] ma'am
[doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep
[patient] nope
[doctor] okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] does that feel the same
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen
[patient] that's great
[doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me
[patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing
[doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards
[patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing
[doctor] not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay
[patient] alright alright sounds good
[doctor] alright thank you you guys have a good day
[patient] doctor
[doctor] bye karen","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right eye twitch.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays soccer every Saturday, however she has noted that there is a girl that tries to kick her and pulls her hair.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient's father reports that they do not have a family history of seizures or Tourette's syndrome.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite.
Eyes: Reports right eye twitch. Denies right eye pain.
Respiratory: Denies cough.
Neurological: Denies headaches or sleep disturbances.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves grossly intact without focal neurologic findings. No pronator drift. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Transient tics.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's father provided a video today as she did not have a twitch in office. It appears the patient is experiencing a tic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: Nature of the diagnosis was discussed today with the patient and her father. I advised eye tics are very common in children and as many as 1 in 5 children have a tick during their school years. We discussed tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization. I explained that essentially they are brief, sudden and involuntary motor movements and that we do not have a full understanding of the cause. We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.
- Medical Treatment: None at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient's parent understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

"[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
[doctor] no i do n't do that
[patient] okay
[doctor] none of us do
[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us
[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
[doctor] yeah i'm okay
[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies
[patient] okay and do you smoke
[doctor] i do n't smoke
[patient] do you live with anybody who does
[doctor] i do not
[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[doctor] okay it does
[patient] alright
[doctor] thank you
[patient] okay no problem

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows some round glass opacities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent lung infections.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: hypersensitivity pneumonitis... another name is farmer's lung | O: started unloading a lot of hay which I don't usually do no I don't [wear a mask] I've been helping my brother out no I have never had any problems with allergies, I don't smoke, | A: I'm a farmer. coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever. every month or every other month especially over the past six months. my symptoms start the days that I'm unloading hay. none of us do. there is ten of us [siblings]. live with anybody who does. eliminate your exposure to the hay or wear a respirator when moving hay. | P: Recurrent lung infections. respiratory rate is twenty oxygen satting fine at ninety nine percent. some fine rales on your lung exam no murmurs rubs or gallops. round glass opacities bacteria and/or mold in the hay. prescribe a course of an oral steroid, CT scan of your lungs, pulmonary function test. the patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","The patient is diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also known as farmer's lung. This is a lung condition characterized by an inflammatory response to inhaled organic dusts, such as those found in farming environments.

The condition can progress to chronic inflammation and fibrosis if left untreated.",The individual had been engaging in an unfamiliar activity of unloading hay without the use of a mask. They had no prior history of allergies and were a non-smoker.,"The farmer, a patient, has been experiencing recurring coughing fits accompanied by mucus production and occasional shortness of breath, along with a low-grade fever, for approximately every one to two months, particularly on days when he unloads hay. No other family members, numbering ten, exhibit similar symptoms. Based on the patient's history, the most likely diagnosis is that of hay fever or allergic rhinitis, aggravated by exposure to hay during unloading. Recommendations for the patient include minimizing exposure to hay or utilizing a respirator when handling it to alleviate symptoms.","The patient, who has a history of recurrent lung infections, is currently experiencing respiratory rate of twenty, but their oxygen saturation levels are normal at ninety-nine percent. A lung exam reveals some fine rales, but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops are present. The physician diagnoses possible bacterial and/or mold infections based on the presence of round glass opacities in the patient's chest X-ray.

To treat the infection, the doctor prescribes a course of oral steroids. Additionally, the patient is scheduled for further diagnostic tests, including a CT scan of their lungs and a pulmonary function test, to assess the extent and severity of the lung damage and to guide the appropriate treatment plan. The patient has been informed and agrees to the recommended medical treatment.","S: The patient is diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also known as farmer's lung.

[patient] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it
[doctor] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending
[patient] okay sorry i got a text and
[doctor] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all
[patient] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner
[doctor] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails
[patient] yeah those those are nice
[doctor] yeah
[patient] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe
[doctor] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side
[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal
[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops
[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started
[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned
[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother
[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot
[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine
[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help
[patient] okay
[doctor] alrighty
[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom
[doctor] yeah ouch
[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt
[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down
[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt
[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further
[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt
[doctor] that hurts more yeah
[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt
[doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too
[patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt
[doctor] a little bit but not terrible
[patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here
[doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely
[patient] okay
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray
[doctor] okay
[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan
[doctor] okay
[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back
[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in
[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint
[doctor] oh
[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage
[doctor] oh
[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach
[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach
[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there
[doctor] yeah
[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call
[doctor] okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot
[doctor] okay
[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes
[doctor] is that surgery
[patient] i have to
[doctor] would that be
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint
[patient] yeah that would
[doctor] okay
[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer
[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done
[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks

Right great toe pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph Walker is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right great toe pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, however it worsened last week. He noticed the pain worsening when he was at a trade show convention and he could not ambulate as he was forced to stand there as the pain was there the whole time. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain usually as throbbing and burning, but notes it occasionally changes to sharp, stabbing pain especially with movement or prolonged ambulation. His symptoms also include redness to the right great toe. The patient states that he has been ambulating on his heel to keep his toe from bending. He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.
Skin: Reports redness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot hallux rigidus.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention.",S: It's almost a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost a sharp stabbing pain especially if I move it or spend too much time walking.

[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay
[patient] thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.","S: I was playing in a soccer game yesterday and I was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my foot... my body ended up twisting around her and I accidentally felt a pain in my foot.

Subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space. | A: Your foot pain is due to a Lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids... You're most likely going to need surgery... to place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal... day surgery... cast... crutches... no use of the left foot for six to eight weeks.

Upon further examination, the piano key test resulted in a positive response. The capillary refill was found to be brisk, and the dorsalis pedis pulse was intact and strong. Motor and sensory functions to light touch were unimpaired. Notably, there was a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal, with a three-millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases. A bony fragment was also identified in the Lisfranc joint space.","The patient is diagnosed with a Lisfranc fracture, specifically affecting one of the second metatarsal bones located at the top of the foot where the metatarsals connect with the cuboids. Surgery is recommended for this condition to realign the bones, with the use of plates and screws for stabilization during the healing process. This is anticipated to be a day surgery, followed by a cast and the need for crutches. The patient is advised to avoid weight-bearing activities on the left foot for approximately six to eight weeks. A potential complication includes poor bone and ligament healing, which may result in the loss of the foot's arch and the development of flat feet. Additionally, there is a high risk of arthritis developing in the affected foot over time.","The patient will be kept out of the rest of the season due to their current condition.

[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Virginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.",S: On the inside Yes it hurts | O: There is a negative varus and valgus stress test. You have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from maybe the twisting motion before you fell to the ground. | A: I do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that knee and when I push around that knee I can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion.

ASSESSMENT

Acute esophagitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and barium swallow findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient Protonix 40 mg first thing in the morning to treat his acute esophagitis. I have also prescribed the patient Carafate 1 gram 4 times daily for 1 month to help coat the lining of his esophagus and stomach. I recommended a upper endoscopy for further evaluation. I have also advised him to change his diet, decrease alcohol, and caffeine. I have also advised him to avoid citrus foods, fruits, and spicy foods until his symptoms have improved. We discussed that he should eat slowly and chew his food thoroughly to avoid big pieces of food. All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 week for his endoscopy.","S: Two areas of mild narrowing in the mid and lower portions of your esophagus... consistent with esophagitis.

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.","S: I was just talking to her and stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong.

She denies any numbness or tingling in her right foot. The patient has been icing and elevating her right ankle while also utilizing ibuprofen last night and this morning, which did not provide her with any relief.

ASSESSMENT

Right ankle sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have advised her to keep her right leg elevated when she is seated. I have also advised her to ice her right ankle 5 times per day for 20 minutes at a time to help with the swelling. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in an Aircast to stabilize the ankle. She will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days, we provided her with crutches today, and then she can begin weight-bearing as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

If her pain does not improve over the next week, she will contact the office and we will obtain an MRI.",S: I was taking out the trash last night and I ended up slipping on a patch of ice and when I fell I heard this pop.

The friend who was visiting had to help the patient get back into the house, and although they were able to put some weight on the affected leg, they were still limping. The pain was constant and described as throbbing, with a warm sensation when touched. Ibuprofen taken after the incident did not provide significant relief. No numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation were reported.","The patient presents with ecchymosis and swelling on the lateral malleolus of the ankle, accompanied by tenderness to palpation in the soft tissue in the anterior and lateral regions.

The pain rate is rated at a six on the pain scale, indicating moderate discomfort. However, due to work obligations, a doctor's note cannot be obtained.

1. Assess the severity of the injury: Based on the pain rating, there might be soft tissue damage such as a sprain or strain. Swelling, bruising, or difficulty bearing weight on the ankle may also indicate a more serious injury, such as a fracture.

2. Consider alternative treatment options: If the injury is not severe enough to warrant a doctor's visit, self-care measures such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) can be recommended. Over-the-counter pain medication can also be suggested to help manage the discomfort.

3. Encourage modifications at work: If the individual's job involves prolonged standing or heavy lifting, modifications can be suggested to minimize the strain on the injured ankle. This may include using a chair for extended periods or rearranging tasks to reduce the need for excessive walking or lifting.

Elizabeth Ross is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.

The patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.",S: I ran into a tree and twisted my knee. THC gummies from grandma.

Regarding his heart failure, he has been pretty good with his salt intake. He has been pretty good about his diet since the last year and is staying on top of that as much as possible. The patient has continued to utilize Lasix daily.

For his hypertension, this has been well controlled with lisinopril 20 mg a day. He has continued to monitor his blood pressure regularly.

The patient did the review of systems sheet when he checked in. He denies weight gain, swelling in the lower extremities, fevers, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Endorses fatigue. Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses cough and shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Endorses bloating.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: JVD 8 cm.
• Respiratory: Rales bilateral bases.
• Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
• Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest demonstrates a mild amount of fluid in the lungs.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45% and mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Brian White is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow up of his chronic problems.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased fatigue, dizziness, and chest discomfort on exertion. He also exhibits some jugular venous distention, lung base crackles, and lower extremity edema on exam today. He has been compliant with his current medications but admits to dietary indiscretion lately. His recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as mitral regurgitation.
• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram.
• Medical Treatment: Increase Lasix to 80 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and record his daily weight and report those to me via the patient portal. He will contact me should he continue to experience any dyspnea.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled based on home monitoring.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to monitor and record his blood pressures at home and report these to me via the patient portal.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Brian is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow-up of his chronic problems. | O: Jugular venous distention to about eight centimeters. 1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.

Fine crackles at the bases bilaterally. Order another echocardiogram. Slight cramps [chest pain] that go away after about an hour. That sounds fine. | P: I just feel out of sorts lately. I don’t know if it’s the change in the seasons or if we’re just doing a lot of projects around the house and some construction on our own. I’m just feeling out of it. Lack of energy. I’m just tired and fatigued, and I feel kinda. I feel lightheaded every once in a while. We began construction on our kitchen over Labor Day weekend, and it was hard to cook or prepare meals. We ate out a lot, and not always the best food out. It wreaked havoc; it’s been maybe off a little bit. Wean yourself every day. I want you to call me if you’re gaining more weight. I monitor it regularly. My wife makes sure I stay on top of that, but it’s been pretty good.

Right knee pain.

HPI:

Ms. Thompson is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right knee pain. She states she was trying to change a lightbulb on a ladder, and she twisted her knee when she stumbled and caught herself from falling yesterday. She has been applying ice and taking Ibuprofen without relief.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen, digoxin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Rhinoplasty.

EXAM

Examination of the right knee shows pain with flexion. Tenderness over the medial joint line. No pain in the calf. Pain with valgus stress. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee show no obvious signs of acute fracture or dislocation. Mild effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION

Right knee acute medial meniscus sprain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a knee brace. She will take Motrin 800 mg, every 6 hours with food, for two weeks. She will use crutches for the next couple of days. She will follow up with me in 1 week for a repeat evaluation. If she is not better at that time, we will obtain an MRI. All questions were answered.","S: It hurts in, in, in the inside of my knee.

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Logan Walker is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who presents today with back pain.

Mr. Walker reports that he was helping his daughter move some heavy equipment and lifted some heavy boxes a little too quickly on Saturday. He thought he heard a pop when he moved and he had to lie down for about an hour before his pain resolved. He has had stiffness ever since. The pain is located in his lower back. He took Tylenol, ibuprofen, and used Icy Hot on the area, but it did not seem to help. The patient endorses some tingling in his toes on his right foot, which resolved Sunday afternoon. He finds it difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep at night, and he tends to lie on his right side, which seems to help a little bit.

Regarding his diabetes type 2, Mr. Walker reports that he has not cooked a meal at home in weeks, due to travel. He notes that his diet has not been great, and he thinks he needs to eat clean for a couple of weeks.

He monitors his blood pressure at home and it is under control for the most part.

Regarding his osteoarthritis, Mr. Walker reports occasional aggravation of his knee when he runs too much or lifts boxes that are too heavy.

The patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills.

The pain worsened with both flexion and extension movements of the back. However, the straight leg raise test resulted in a negative finding. A back x-ray revealed normal results. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin A1c level was slightly elevated at 8%. The patient did not report any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever. Based on these findings, the healthcare provider prescribed meloxicam 15mg once daily for pain management and referred the patient to physical therapy for rehabilitation.","The father, while helping his daughter with heavy equipment, hastily lifted some boxes that were too heavy for him. As a result, he experienced discomfort and an elevated blood pressure during a subsequent medical office visit. This pain could potentially contribute to further increases in his blood pressure.

Tingling sensations were present in the toes of the affected foot until Sunday afternoon. Sleeping comfortably has been a challenge, with lying on the side providing some relief. The patient enjoys peanut butter cups. Their diet has been less than ideal due to their busy schedule, helping their daughter, and lack of home-cooked meals. The patient's metformin dosage has been increased to 1000mg twice a day, and a hemoglobin A1c repeat is scheduled for 6 months in the future.
O: The patient presented with lower back pain, which was evident upon palpation of the lumbar spine. The pain worsened with both flexion and extension movements of the back. However, the straight leg raise test resulted in a negative finding. A back x-ray revealed normal results. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin A1c level was slightly elevated at 8%. The patient did not report any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever. Based on these findings, the healthcare provider prescribed meloxicam 15mg once daily for pain management and referred the patient to physical therapy for rehabilitation.
A: The father, while helping his daughter with heavy equipment, hastily lifted some boxes that were too heavy for him. As a result, he experienced discomfort and an elevated blood pressure during a subsequent medical office visit. This pain could potentially contribute to further increases in his blood pressure. The father acknowledged the issue and agreed with the assessment.
P: The medical plan calls for an upward adjustment of the patient's lisinopril dosage from 10mg to 20mg each day."

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ralph Barnes is a 62-year-old male who presents for his annual examination.

Annual visit.
• Additional Testing: I have ordered his routine blood work and will follow up with the patient via the portal once results are back.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well with his current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Prozac 20 mg a day and I provided a refill of that today.

History of lobectomy.
• Medical Reasoning: I do not think we need to do any more work up for this issue. He is able to exercise a lot and his breathing function is back. I do not think he needs to follow up with the surgeon anymore.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well on his current regimen. His blood pressure was normal today and has been trending well over the past several years.
• Additional Testing: I ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate his murmur.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Norvasc.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: hear a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur, and your lungs sound nice and clear... pain to palpation of the sinuses here. continue Prozac 20 milligrams daily... continue Norvasc... order an echocardiogram for that murmur. | O: we dropped my oldest daughter off at college and moved her into her dorm, little stressful, little chaotic in the heat of the summer.

Right finger pain.

HPI:

Ms. Brooks is a 48-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right finger pain. She states she was skiing on Sunday and hyperextended her finger when it became caught in a strap on a jump. She has tried applying ice and taking Ibuprofen, but it is still very painful. She has pain with movement.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

MiraLax

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Constipation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Appendectomy.

EXAM

Examination of the right index finger shows tenderness over the distal phalanx. No tenderness over the proximal phalanx or the MP joint. Pain with flexion.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right hand show no obvious signs of fracture or bony abnormalities.

IMPRESSION

Right hand index finger contusion at the tip of the finger.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a splint. She will take Motrin 600 mg every 6 hours for a week. If she does not improve, she will follow up with me. All questions were answered.","S: I was skiing over the weekend... tried moguls, which jumping over those big hills, I tend to get my strap caught on my finger... it bent it back a bit.

[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .
[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .
[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .
[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?
[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .
[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?
[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .
[doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?
[patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ?
[patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ?
[patient] no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .
[doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?
[patient] no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .
[doctor] i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ?
[patient] i was adopted so i really have no idea .
[doctor] okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ?
[patient] i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .
[doctor] that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ?
[patient] nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .
[doctor] okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal .
[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .
[patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .
[doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .
[patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?
[doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .

[doctor] okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery .
[patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .
[doctor] yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .

Pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.

The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.

Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.

The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Newly diagnosed pituitary lesion.

Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma
• Bitemporal hemianopia

Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.

PLAN

Pituitary adenoma.
We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.

Bitemporal hemianopia.
We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.
• Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.","S: Patient reports bumping into door frames recently. | O: 52-year-old male with newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. MRI brain with contrast shows pituitary lesion compressing the optic chiasm.

Surgical intervention via transsphenoidal approach is indicated to decompress the optic chiasm. | A: Worsening headaches over the past few months. Headaches located behind the eyes, described as a dull nagging ache. Onset was gradual, starting at 3 out of 10 severity and gradually worsening to 6 out of 10. Headaches tend to be worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. No fever, rash, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or syncope. Risks include infection, spinal fluid leak, stroke, and death. | P: Patient will undergo pre-surgery visual field testing with ophthalmology to establish baseline. Patient understands risks and wishes to proceed with surgery despite no guarantees of vision recovery.","The patient is believed to have a pituitary adenoma, a non-cancerous growth in the pituitary gland. However, a definitive diagnosis will require pathological confirmation following surgical intervention. Due to the compression of the optic chiasm, a transsphenoidal approach, which involves accessing the pituitary gland through the sphenoid sinus, is recommended to alleviate the pressure and prevent potential vision loss.","A 52-year-old man underwent a series of diagnostic tests due to the recent identification of a pituitary lesion. During a visual field examination, bitemporal hemianopia, or the loss of peripheral vision in both eyes, was detected. Subsequently, an MRI scan of the brain with contrast was performed, which revealed a pituitary lesion that was compressing the optic chiasm. Furthermore, a pituitary hormone profile was obtained, which indicated a low Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level, while all other results were reported as normal.

[patient] um , early october .
[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?
[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .
[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?
[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?

[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .

Esophagitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.

The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.

The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.

PAST HISTORY

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular:  Positive for chest pain.
• Gastrointestinal:  Positive for difficulty swallowing.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

RESULTS

The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

Non-cardiac chest pain.

Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.

PLAN

• We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.
• Follow up as needed.","S: She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia. She's a new patient with a referral from the ER of esophagitis. Possible etiologies could be anxiety, esophagitis, which is irritation of the esophagus. But typically with these... these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident you had... it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days. | O: Early October. [Doctor] of 2020, correct? [Patient] Yes. With eating. | A: When I called to make the appointment, I was having chest pains, but it stopped after four days, and I haven't had any since. It was here in the center of my chest, behind my breastbone. It felt like I was having a heart attack. The pain was really sharp. I did. [Doctor].

She was referred from the ER due to esophagitis, a condition characterized by irritation of the esophagus. The potential causes could be anxiety or esophagitis itself. However, the symptoms of long-lasting pain are usually associated with fibroids or anemia. An isolated incident of intense heartburn for a few days could also be a possibility.","In early October of 2020, during a clinical examination, the doctor asked the patient if their eating patterns had changed. The patient confirmed that this was the case.","The patient had experienced chest pains, which felt like a heart attack, located in the center of their chest behind the breastbone.

She was referred from the ER due to esophagitis, a condition characterized by irritation of the esophagus. The potential causes could be anxiety or esophagitis itself. However, the symptoms of long-lasting pain are usually associated with fibroids or anemia. An isolated incident of intense heartburn for a few days could also be a possibility.
O: In early October of 2020, during a clinical examination, the doctor asked the patient if their eating patterns had changed. The patient confirmed that this was the case.

[patient_guest] katherine , she was doing fine . she just had problems with eating , where she would stop breathing when she was eating .
[doctor] like preemie type stuff ?
[patient_guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient_guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .
[doctor] good . is she in therapy ?
[patient_guest] she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .
[doctor] awesome . okay .
[patient_guest] and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient_guest] so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really .
[doctor] and audiology too , right ?
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] yeah , wow. .
[patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .
[doctor] okay . okay .
[patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .
[doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?

[doctor] okay . great .
[patient_guest] yeah , she seems to pee a lot , and it feels like she drinks a lot too .
[doctor] that's perfect .
[patient_guest] and she used to only drink milk , and then i took her off dairy milk . so when i say milk , i actually mean , you know , ripple pea protein milk .
[doctor] sure , yeah .
[patient_guest] so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .

[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] i do n't even think she's a pound hav- heavier , actually .
[doctor] yeah . yeah .
[patient_guest] but she is a little bit taller than her ... um , katherine . she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .
[doctor] yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds okay .
[doctor] okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound .
[patient_guest] all right , thank you .
[doctor] okay , yeah . where do you all live ?

Renal screening tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs.

The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.

[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just really along my wrist
[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace
[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[patient] six weeks
[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of

Right wrist injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.

The patient is going on vacation in 1 month.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 80 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.
Body Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.
HEAD: Normocephalic
NECK: No swelling noted
CV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
GI/GU: Non-distended
BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity
NECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.
MSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.

ASSESSMENT

Right wrist Colles fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.

In the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.",S: I was walking up and down the stairs... I slipped and tried to catch myself... my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen. On a scale of one to ten... it's a nine. I did the ice thing... ACE wrap... ibuprofen. Going on vacation in a month... postpone... consult physical therapy. | O: Ultram 50 mg every six hours. A little numbness and tingling in the fingers. Blood pressure elevated at 140/70... heart rate 80 bpm. Physical therapy three times a week to strengthen the wrist. | A: Fracture could heal and malform if not stabilized with screws. | P: Obvious swelling and bruising... tenderness on palpation... bony crepitus. Pain on flexion and extension... radial deviation and lateral deviation. Colles' fracture... dinner fork deformity... ulnar styloid fracture. Thumb spica brace... surgery as soon as possible... overnight stay... physical therapy a few weeks after surgery... six weeks in the brace.,"The patient was using the stairs when they experienced a fall. During the fall, they attempted to break their fall by using their hand, resulting in severe pain and swelling in their wrist. The patient rated the pain as a nine out of ten. They have since applied ice, used an ACE wrap, and taken ibuprofen for relief. With a scheduled vacation in a month, the patient is considering postponing the trip and plans to consult with a physical therapist for further evaluation and treatment.",The patient is currently taking Ultram in a dose of 50 mg every six hours. There is a sensation of numbness and tingling in the fingers. The blood pressure reading was elevated at 140/70 mmHg with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute. Physical therapy sessions are scheduled three times a week to enhance the wrist's strength.,"The assessment suggests that a fracture may not heal properly if not stabilized with screws. If left unstabilized, the fracture could result in malformation during the healing process.","The patient is diagnosed with a Colles' fracture and an ulnar styloid fracture, both evident by noticeable swelling, bruising, and tenderness. The wrist exhibits pain during flexion and extension, as well as radial and lateral deviation. Bony crepitus is also present. A dinner fork deformity is observed, indicating the severity of the Colles' fracture.

Immediate treatment includes the application of a thumb spica brace to immobilize the wrist and provide support. Surgery is recommended as soon as possible for optimal healing. An overnight hospital stay is necessary following the procedure.

After surgery, the patient will undergo physical therapy a few weeks later to regain strength and mobility in the wrist. They are required to wear the thumb spica brace for six weeks to ensure proper healing and alignment.","S: The patient was using the stairs when they experienced a fall.

O: The patient is currently taking Ultram in a dose of 50 mg every six hours. There is a sensation of numbness and tingling in the fingers. The blood pressure reading was elevated at 140/70 mmHg with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute. Physical therapy sessions are scheduled three times a week to enhance the wrist's strength.
A: The assessment suggests that a fracture may not heal properly if not stabilized with screws. If left unstabilized, the fracture could result in malformation during the healing process.
P: The patient is diagnosed with a Colles' fracture and an ulnar styloid fracture, both evident by noticeable swelling, bruising, and tenderness. The wrist exhibits pain during flexion and extension, as well as radial and lateral deviation. Bony crepitus is also present. A dinner fork deformity is observed, indicating the severity of the Colles' fracture.

Immediate treatment includes the application of a thumb spica brace to immobilize the wrist and provide support. Surgery is recommended as soon as possible for optimal healing. An overnight hospital stay is necessary following the procedure.

After surgery, the patient will undergo physical therapy a few weeks later to regain strength and mobility in the wrist. They are required to wear the thumb spica brace for six weeks to ensure proper healing and alignment."

Right knee pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Some edema and effusion noted around the right knee.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Right knee
- Palpation: Pain to palpation of the medial aspect. No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect.
- ROM: Pain with flexion and extension.
-Some effusion noted around the right knee.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were taken. These show no fractures or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee MCL strain.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the physical examination findings, the patient has a MCL strain of the right knee. - Medical Treatment: I have prescribed ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day. I will also place him in a knee brace. I advised him to ice the knee for 20 minutes at a time for 3 to 4 times a day. The patient was instructed to elevate his leg as needed and avoid strenuous activities for 2-3 weeks.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. I have also provided a referral to see a nutritionist for dietary changes.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: Right knee pain after slipping and falling, feeling a pop, swelling, and pain during flexion/extension. Pain score 4/5 during mobility, minimal pain when stationary. Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard on heart exam (pre-existing). | O: Diagnosed with medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain. | A: Accidental slip and fall on property a week ago caused knee issues. X-ray shows no fractures or bony abnormalities. Continuing lisinopril 20 mg daily; diet non-compliant, referred to nutritionist for sodium intake reduction. Avoid strenuous activity; family assistance advised for yard work. | P: Pain to palpation of the medial knee, limited flexion/extension, edema, and effusion noted. Prescribed ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily, knee brace, icing (20 mins, 3-4x/day), and elevation/rest for 2-3 weeks.","The patient experienced a slip and fall incident that resulted in pain in the right knee. Following the fall, there was a sensation of the knee ""popping."" Swelling and pain were noted during both flexion and extension movements. The patient reported a pain score of 4 out of 5 during mobility, but minimal discomfort when at rest. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was detected during a heart examination, which was a pre-existing condition.","The individual underwent a thorough physical examination which revealed signs of a strain injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in their knee. The MCL is one of the ligaments that provides stability to the knee by preventing it from bending inward. The diagnosis was based on the presence of symptoms such as pain, swelling, and instability in the affected knee, as well as the results of specific tests performed by the healthcare professional. The MCL strain suggests that the ligament has been overstretched or partially torn, leading to the observed symptoms. Further assessment and treatment, such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), physical therapy, or in severe cases, surgery, may be recommended to facilitate healing and restore full function to the affected knee.","A week ago, X experienced a slip and fall accident on their property, resulting in knee issues. Following the incident, an X-ray examination was conducted, which revealed no fractures or abnormalities in the bones. However, X's condition continues to cause discomfort. Their ongoing medication includes lisinopril at a dosage of 20 mg daily.

Despite this, X's dietary habits have been non-compliant, and they have been advised to consult with a nutritionist for managing their sodium intake to support their recovery. To avoid further aggravating their knee issues, X should avoid engaging in strenuous activities. Additionally, it would be beneficial for X to enlist the help of their family members in managing yard work and other physically demanding tasks.","The patient was observed to have pain in the medial knee, which was accompanied by limited flexion and extension, swelling, and effusion. In response to these symptoms, the healthcare provider prescribed ibuprofen at a dosage of 800 mg twice daily. In addition, a knee brace was recommended for use, along with icing the affected area for approximately 20 minutes, three to four times a day.

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.","S: deep in the patella... the whole kneecap fades. | O: No ecchymosis or edema, no effusion, no pain to palpation... full range of motion, negative varus and valgus test. No evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. Some arthritis in the knee... systolic ejection murmur heard on heart exam. Prescribe meloxicam 15 mg daily... physical therapy... continue lisinopril... order echocardiogram, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid panel. Trip to Columbus, Georgia... Lion’s Club function with line dancing planned. | A: it just gives out and here I'm going to fall but I usually catch myself... I have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot. it comes and goes and it passes just about as quickly as it comes... doesn't last that long. No... not that I can recall Not interfering with things I do... won’t be able to participate in line dancing due to knee concerns. | P: Blood pressure runs around 120 over 70... currently controlled. Taking Farxiga and amlodipine... lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide... metformin morning and night. Fasting morning blood sugars are about 130... slightly higher but not extremely.","The patient described experiencing a fading sensation in the kneecap, specifically located deep within it.","During the physical examination, no ecchymosis or edema was observed in the knee area, and there was no evidence of effusion or pain upon palpation. The patient displayed full range of motion in the knee, and both varus and valgus tests came back negative. No fractures or bony abnormalities were detected. However, some signs of arthritis were present in the knee.

During the heart exam, a systolic ejection murmur was heard. Based on these findings, the healthcare provider prescribed meloxicam at a dose of 15 mg daily. Physical therapy was also recommended for the knee. The patient was instructed to continue taking lisinopril.

Additional tests were ordered, including an echocardiogram, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid panel. The patient had plans to travel to Columbus, Georgia, for a Lion’s Club function involving line dancing.","The patient expresses feelings of instability and impending falling, but manages to prevent falls with the aid of a grocery cart. These episodes are described as brief and infrequent, not interfering significantly with daily activities. The patient does not recall any previous instances of this symptom and mentions having knee concerns, which may prevent participation in certain physical activities like line dancing. The patient's clinical presentation suggests a transient and mildly disabling condition, possibly related to vestibular or proprioceptive dysfunction, rather than a more serious neurological issue. However, further evaluation is needed to confirm a definitive diagnosis.","The individual's blood pressure is well-controlled at around 120 over 70 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). They are currently taking multiple medications as part of their treatment regimen. These include Farxiga and amlodipine for blood pressure management, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide as additional blood pressure medications, and metformin both in the morning and evening for managing elevated blood sugar levels. Their fasting morning blood sugars are slightly higher than the desired range, averaging around 130 mg/dL. The healthcare team will continue to monitor the individual's blood pressure and blood sugar levels closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed.","S: The patient described experiencing a fading sensation in the kneecap, specifically located deep within it.
O: During the physical examination, no ecchymosis or edema was observed in the knee area, and there was no evidence of effusion or pain upon palpation. The patient displayed full range of motion in the knee, and both varus and valgus tests came back negative. No fractures or bony abnormalities were detected. However, some signs of arthritis were present in the knee.

During the heart exam, a systolic ejection murmur was heard. Based on these findings, the healthcare provider prescribed meloxicam at a dose of 15 mg daily. Physical therapy was also recommended for the knee. The patient was instructed to continue taking lisinopril.

Additional tests were ordered, including an echocardiogram, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid panel. The patient had plans to travel to Columbus, Georgia, for a Lion’s Club function involving line dancing.
A: The patient expresses feelings of instability and impending falling, but manages to prevent falls with the aid of a grocery cart. These episodes are described as brief and infrequent, not interfering significantly with daily activities. The patient does not recall any previous instances of this symptom and mentions having knee concerns, which may prevent participation in certain physical activities like line dancing. The patient's clinical presentation suggests a transient and mildly disabling condition, possibly related to vestibular or proprioceptive dysfunction, rather than a more serious neurological issue. However, further evaluation is needed to confirm a definitive diagnosis.
P: The individual's blood pressure is well-controlled at around 120 over 70 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). They are currently taking multiple medications as part of their treatment regimen. These include Farxiga and amlodipine for blood pressure management, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide as additional blood pressure medications, and metformin both in the morning and evening for managing elevated blood sugar levels. Their fasting morning blood sugars are slightly higher than the desired range, averaging around 130 mg/dL. The healthcare team will continue to monitor the individual's blood pressure and blood sugar levels closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed."

[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss
[patient] great
[doctor] okay any questions for me
[patient] i do n't believe so at this time

[doctor] ready
[patient] hi kyle how are you today
[doctor] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today
[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding
[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me
[patient] yeah that's a mouthful
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here
[doctor] i'll do this
[patient] i i think i would break that
[doctor] yeah i just saw that
[patient] if you can do that
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just
[doctor] okay
[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up
[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me
[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections
[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual
[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections
[doctor] diarrhea no
[patient] frequently
[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of
[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies
[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy
[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes
[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street
[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes
[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that
[doctor] i know i know
[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea
[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and
[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency
[doctor] why is that
[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency
[doctor] okay okay thank you
[patient] you're welcome

Kyle Lee is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of low immunoglobulin A level. He was referred to our offices by his primary care physician after routine labs revealed abnormalities. The patient states he has been experiencing frequent infections. During the winter months, he experiences frequent colds that tend to linger, however this is not uncommon for him. The patient denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.

The patient was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He is currently taking metformin.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient denies a history of blood transfusions.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He recently traveled internationally on a trip to Zambia. His family owns a local doughnut shop.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient denies a family history of immune deficiencies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal issues or diarrhea.

VITALS

Temperature: Normal.
All other vitals were reviewed and are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NECK: No swelling noted. No lymphadenopathy.
CV: Normal heart rhythm with no murmurs.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear. There's no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen is soft and without tenderness.

RESULTS

I did review the results of her recent lab work. It is consistent as her primary care physician noted with an IgA deficiency.

ASSESSMENT

IgA deficiency.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that the results of his recent lab work is consistent with an IgA deficiency. I have recommended that we obtain additional blood work to check his other antibodies. I encouraged the patient to be aware of lingering infections or abdominal changes including diarrhea. If he experiences these issues, he should report them to my office so we may investigate further, however I do not believe there is a need for that at this time. In the meantime, he should report this IgA deficiency in the event that he needs any blood transfusions. Questions were invited and answered today.","S: one of the antibodies your body makes to fight infections. I get a lot of colds and they do seem to linger for a long time. no abdominal infections... no diarrhea. no one in my family has immune deficiencies. lab results are consistent with an IgA deficiency. if you ever need blood products, they need to know about your IgA deficiency to avoid a strong reaction. | O: no fever, normal vitals, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, soft abdomen without tenderness. severe diarrhea. | A: started on metformin clear lungs, other antibodies | P: infections that don’t stop","The individual frequently experiences prolonged bouts of the common cold. No instances of abdominal infections or diarrhea have been reported. There is no known immune deficiency within their family. Laboratory findings indicate a deficiency in IgA, a type of antibody that aids in fighting infections. In case of blood transfusions, it is essential to inform the medical team about this condition to prevent adverse reactions.","The patient presented with no signs of fever and normal vital signs, including a regular heart rhythm without any murmurs. A soft abdomen was palpated during the examination, but there was no tenderness present. Notably, the patient was experiencing severe diarrhea.","The patient began taking metformin, a medication commonly used for type 2 diabetes management, while exhibiting clear lung function. Concurrently, other antibodies were identified during the assessment. Clinical reasoning suggests that the metformin prescription was likely initiated for managing the patient's diabetes, unrelated to their lung condition. The presence of other antibodies indicates the possibility of an ongoing infection or an autoimmune disorder. Further investigation and diagnostic tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause and potential connection between the patient's diabetes, lung function, and identified antibodies.","The patient was diagnosed with recurring infections that failed to respond to conventional treatments. The healthcare team devised a comprehensive plan to address the underlying causes and prevent future episodes.

First, the team initiated intravenous antibiotics to eradicate the current infection. Simultaneously, they conducted extensive tests to identify any underlying conditions contributing to the recurrent infections, such as immunodeficiencies or chronic diseases.

During the hospitalization, the healthcare team closely monitored the patient's condition and adjusted the antibiotic therapy as necessary. Once the patient's condition stabilized, they were discharged and prescribed a prolonged course of oral antibiotics to complete the treatment.

To prevent future infections, the healthcare team recommended several measures. They advised the patient to maintain good hygiene practices, including regular handwashing and keeping wounds clean. They also prescribed probiotics to help restore the balance of gut bacteria and strengthen the immune system.

The patient was referred to a specialist for further evaluation and management of any underlying conditions. The healthcare team scheduled regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The discomfort primarily stayed at the elbow, but it could extend into the forearm. They mentioned trying ibuprofen for relief, but the medication only provided minimal relief. The patient also noted that the pain worsened when they pronounced their forearm. The healthcare provider recommended ordering a sling for the patient and instructed them to wear it while awake. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in a week to assess their progress.","Over the past week, the individual has been actively engaged in ceramics and pottery work, which has resulted in the development of elbow pain. The pain has made it difficult for the person to lift objects and perform certain tasks due to discomfort. No apparent cause for the pain has been identified.","The patient was found to exhibit tenderness on palpation of the medial epicondyle in the left wrist. This tenderness was moderate in intensity. Furthermore, the patient reported pain upon resistance against flexion of the same wrist, indicating symptoms consistent with medial epicondylitis. The diagnosis suggests an overuse injury, likely caused by repeated strain or damage to the tendons responsible for bending the wrist towards the palm.","The patient is advised not to see a fracture or any bony abnormality in their elbow. They should apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day as a means of relief. Additionally, they are prescribed ibuprofen at a dosage of 600 mg every six hours, to be taken with food, for an entire week. For the following couple of weeks, they are instructed to avoid engaging in any pottery work.","S: The patient reported experiencing significant pain on the inside of their elbow.

- General Examination: No JVD

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 2/6 stable systolic ejection murmur

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Lower extremities show trace edema.

RESULTS

An echocardiogram, obtained at an outside facility, was reviewed today. It demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction of 55%. Normal diastolic filling. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Treatment:
The treatment plan for the patient may involve monitoring the condition closely through regular follow-up appointments. The patient may be advised to make lifestyle modifications, such as engaging in regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy diet, to help improve heart health. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage any underlying conditions contributing to the murmur, such as high blood pressure or heart valve disease.

Follow-up:
The patient will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor the stability of the murmur and assess any changes in heart function. The healthcare provider may use various diagnostic tests, such as echocardiograms or stress tests, to evaluate the heart's structure and function. Based on the results of these tests, the treatment plan may be adjusted as necessary to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient.","S: The patient reportedly experienced a fall outside.

[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.","S: comes and goes... pretty bad... can't find a comfortable position. it kinda burns a little bit [when urinating] urine looks a little dark sometimes.

"[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy

Non-healing ulcer on his right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas Gutierrez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.

Today, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.

The patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient enjoys hiking.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports subjective fever and chills
Respiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath with ambulation.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea and vomiting.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and right calf cramping.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.

VITALS

Temperature is slightly elevated.
Vitals are otherwise good.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.

ASSESSMENT

Right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.
Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.

In regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.",S: Debridement today in the office... culture and different antibiotic therapy... venous ultrasound... continue antibiotics... follow-up in seven days... monitor blood sugars with endocrinologist. | O: Non-healing foot ulcer on your foot No evidence of osteomyelitis Redness moving up the leg... swelling and pain in calf... closely monitor. | A: I first noticed it when I put on a pair of shoes that were a little bit too tight... saw a blister... burning and stinging... thick soft mushy skin... bad smell with some yellow drainage. The blister had become unroofed... underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin... turned black around the outside of the wound... cramping in my calf muscle... red streak... super super hot. Started me on some antibiotics about six days ago... never had any nausea or vomiting... chills... felt pretty good but... red streak... calf cramping. Coughing a lot the last two days... difficult time catching my breath when I'm walking around the house. Diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy... A1c is six point seven... blood sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks... one spike at five or six hundred. | P: Necrotic wound on his heel... approximately two by two centimeters... sloughing of the tissue... erythema... foul odor... no bony exposure... no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse... present via Doppler.,"In the course of today's office visit, the healthcare professional performed a debridement on the patient. A culture was taken from the wound site for laboratory analysis, and based on the preliminary assessment, a new antibiotic therapy was initiated. The patient underwent a venous ultrasound to evaluate their circulation. The healthcare professional instructed the patient to continue taking the prescribed antibiotics and scheduled a follow-up appointment in seven days. Additionally, the patient was advised to monitor their blood sugars closely and consult with an endocrinologist for further management.","The individual presents with a persistent foot ulcer that fails to heal. During the physical examination, no signs of osteomyelitis were detected. However, there are noticeable symptoms of redness ascending the leg, accompanied by swelling and pain localized in the calf. The healthcare professional advises close monitoring of these symptoms.","The patient first observed a blister on their foot caused by a tight shoe. The blister had since become unroofed, revealing thick, soft, and mushy skin that had turned black around the edges. The wound was accompanied by a bad smell and yellow drainage. The patient also reported cramping in their calf muscle and a red streak emanating from the wound. Six days prior, they had begun taking antibiotics due to concerns of infection. Though they had experienced no nausea or vomiting, they did report chills and feeling generally unwell. Additionally, they were diabetic with a high A1c level of 6.7 and had likely had elevated blood sugars in the range of 300-500 mg/dL for the past two weeks, with one spike reaching 500 mg/dL. Recent symptoms included increased coughing and difficulty breathing while moving around the house. Clinical reasoning suggests that the patient may be experiencing a diabetic foot infection, possibly with necrotizing fasciitis, which warrants further evaluation and potentially surgical intervention.","A man is being treated for a necrotic wound on his heel, which is roughly two by two centimeters in size.

The treatment and follow-up for this individual will likely involve debridement of the necrotic tissue, possibly with the use of negative pressure wound therapy, as well as regular monitoring of wound progression and vascular status. Antibiotics may also be administered to address any potential infection.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S: I really don't know where I got it but I do get out in the woods and I do spend a lot of time out in the yard but I've got a tick bite around my knee and it's been over a week and it just burns and just quite annoying.
