A,"The blood pressure was pretty high in the ER, almost 200. My blood pressures have been running high in the past... once a week, a month, it just skyrockets. You're not taking your blood pressures, I take it? I am taking the lisinopril. The ECG looks the same as last year... you do have those changes from your chronic high blood pressure. I want to increase the lisinopril to 40 milligrams once a day. It's good to see you.","The blood pressure was pretty high in the ER, almost 200.

O,"Your heart on your heart exam does show that you have a slight 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur. You do have some trace pitting edema to your lower extremities bilaterally. The echocardiogram... shows you have that slightly leaky heart valve, nothing to do for it, and that the heart murmur is stable.","Your heart on your heart exam does show that you have a slight 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.

S,"I ended up going for a walk yesterday 'cause it was sunny and it was really great. And I just felt really light-headed, and I started to fall a bit, and luckily I was with my boyfriend and he caught me, and we went to the ER. It usually ends up being I'm traveling a lot that week for work, I'm not eating as... No, I don't bring my cuff with me [while traveling]. Last year I started therapy and I've been going once a week and that's really helped. My boyfriend, my mom, and my brother are amazing and they're all super close to me, it's been good. I have a little bit of nasal congestion, but that's just from my seasonal allergies. For your depression, I don't think we need to start you on any medication... you can contact me if you need anything.","I ended up going for a walk yesterday 'cause it was sunny and it was really great.
