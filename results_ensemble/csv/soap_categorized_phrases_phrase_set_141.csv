A,1,2,He had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year.
A,1,0,"He was offered an injection of the A1 polyregion, but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone, which causes his heart to race."
S,0,2,"MRI of that finger, because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of, quote, 'FDS tendon,' end quote."
S,0,1,"partial-thickness tear of the fds, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons."
S,0,0,"Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact, as the mcp joint capsule. Extensor tendons also deemed intact."
S,0,1,"X-rays, four views of the hand today, show no bony abnormalities, joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the hand, no soft tissue shadows of concern, no arthritis."
O,3,2,"I can't make a fist, but sometimes the pain's unbearable. And, even driving hurts."
O,3,0,"The MRI came back, and it said I had a tear in my finger, but he wasn't gonna give me an injection, because the injection was going to make the tear worse."
O,3,1,"I'm thinking that you told me you wouldn't do an injection in there, and the occupational therapy says it's because of the tear."
O,3,1,"I came to see if you could do anything for this hand, because I am -handed, and I kinda need that hand."
P,2,0,I'm an x-ray tech.
A,1,1,there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons... the FDS is the least important of the two. The one that goes all the way to the tip is good.
O,3,2,"I would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection, and I would avoid the dexamethasone, because I saw you have a little reaction to that. But we could use the betamethasone, which is a celestone."
A,1,2,"the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle, with contortions of the hand, and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick."
P,2,0,"Recommended icing in it this evening, and taking ibuprofen."
S,0,1,"I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed."
S,0,1,I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.
S,0,0,the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that he is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.
S,0,1,"Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery."
