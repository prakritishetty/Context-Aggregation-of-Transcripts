The patient went for a walk yesterday and began to feel lightheaded. She started to fall, however she was with her boyfriend, who caught her. She presented to the emergency room after this. While in the emergency room, her blood pressure was nearly 200 and she had a headache.

Her blood pressure is typically normal, however will become elevated approximately one week a month. She notes it is typically elevated because she is traveling a lot that week for work. While traveling, she is not eating as well and does not monitor her blood pressure. The patient is taking her lisinopril as prescribed.

Regarding her depression, she states she is doing well. Last year she started therapy and she has been going once a week, which has helped. Her support system is great and includes her boyfriend, mom, and brother.

The patient notes she has a little bit of nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies. She denies chest pain and shortness of breath.

ASSESSMENT

Ms. Diane Baker is a 28-year-old female with a past medical history significant for depression, and hypertension, who presents for emergency room follow-up.

PLAN

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is not controlled at this time. The patient presented to the emergency department yesterday with an elevated blood pressure, presyncope, and headache. She has been compliant with lisinopril, but her blood pressures have been spiking once a month based on home monitoring; however, she admits to not taking her blood pressures while traveling recently. A recent EKG revealed changes from her chronic high blood pressure.
• Medical Treatment: Increase lisinopril to 40 mg once a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will continue to check her blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal. We will have to make adjustments if necessary.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well with weekly therapy.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current management strategies. No medication to start at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She can contact me if she needs anything.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Butler is a 61-year-old male presenting with complaints of shortness of breath.

The patient states that over the weekend, he took a very long bike ride for approximately 3 hours, and when he returned, he was very lightheaded and short of breath. He notes that it was difficult to catch his breath afterward. He endorses that he had mild chest pain at that time, however, it eventually went away after about an hour. He denies any fever at this time or any other symptoms at this time. No other members in his family have been sick.

The patient is currently taking Imitrex as needed for his migraines. His migraines are under control and he avoids exposure to bright lights.

The patient is currently taking Protonix for his reflux and he is doing well with this.

The patient had cataract surgery about 4.5 months ago. He notes that his vision is okay since then.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: No fevers.
• Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses a cough. Endorses shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Endorses reflux.
• Neurological: Endorses migraines. Endorses lightheadedness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Supple.  No jugular venous distension.
• Respiratory: Slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test are within normal limits.

X-ray of the chest is unremarkable.

CBC: Within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 61-year-old male who presents for shortness of breath.

Shortness of breath.
• Medical Reasoning: I reviewed the patient's chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, and labs which were all normal. He does have slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally on exam. I suspect his episode of shortness of breath was due to an exacerbation of asthma.
• Medical Treatment: I would like to prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.
• Specialist Referral: I have referred him to pulmonology for an asthma workup.

Acid reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This seems stable.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended the patient continue Protonix.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: This problem is also stable. Continue on Imitrex as needed.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended he continue Imitrex as needed for migraines.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow-up in 2 weeks or sooner if his conditions worsen.","S:

[patient] i'm good . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well . so , i know the nurse told you about dax . i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you when we get started , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , joyce is a 50 year old female with a past medical history significant for copd , congestive heart failure who presents for follow-up to an abnormal lab finding . so , joyce , i , i got the results of your lab , uh , your labs . your hemoglobin was low . uh , so , i asked them to schedule a follow-up appointment with me . so , how are you feeling ?
[patient] i've been feeling really tired lately . over the past couple of months , i've noticed that my energy has really gone down . i used to be really active , um , just trying to be as healthy as i can be , running, climbing . um , i at least try to do an hour or two a day . and over the past month , it's gone slowly downhill . i've just been so tired and exhausted and i have n't been able to really keep up with the way i , i was g- was going with my exercise .

[patient] it's been okay . um , i have n't been smoking . i ... after i quit , i quit cold turkey and i have n't gone back since . so , that's been doing well . i think , uh , during the changes of season , it gets a little bit harder for me to breathe , but i think that's just because of my allergies .
[doctor] okay . all right . and then from a congestive heart failure standpoint , are you watching your diet , you're watching your salt intake ?
[patient] yeah . i've been doing really well with that . i've been staying away from the french fries , and all the other salty foods that i love to eat , uh , and everything looks great .

[doctor] i give you a lot of credit for staying away from french fries .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . all right . well , your vital signs here in the office look good , so , i'm , i'm really happy to see that with the abnormal hemoglobin that we saw . um , i'm gon na just listen to your heart and lungs and press on your belly a little bit and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?
[patient] okay .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's look at some of your results , okay ?

[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] for your next problem , the copd , i think you're doing great . you know , i , i do n't think that you , uh , need any further referrals at this time for that . i would just continue staying away from smoking . it does n't sound to be like you need any inhalers at this time . uh , for your third problem , your congestive heart failure , you know , i wan na continue you on the toprol , continue you on the lisinopril and we'll continue you on your current diuretic dosing of 20 , lasix 20 milligrams a day .

Follow-up to an abnormal labs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joyce Price is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure who presents for follow-up to an abnormal lab finding.

The patient reports that she has been feeling really tired lately. She reports that over the past couple of months, her energy has really gone down. She used to be really active, trying to be as healthy as she can be with running and climbing, at least an hour or two a day. Over the past month, her activity has slowly decreased. She reports that, due to her fatigue, she has not been able to keep up with her exercise. She reports that she had noticed a little weight loss, but she believes that was due to her doing really well with her exercises.

The patient reports that her COPD is doing well. She reports that she has not been smoking since she quit. She reports that during the changes of the season, it gets a little harder for her to breathe, but she believes that is because of her allergies.

From a congestive heart failure standpoint, she reports that she has been doing really well with her diet. She reports that she has been staying away from French fries and all the other salty foods that she likes to eat. She denies any swelling in her legs.

She reports that she has a good support system with her boyfriend and her brother.

She reports that she has not noticed any blood in her stool at this time. She denies that her stools are dark or black in color. She denies that she has had any abnormal bleeding between menses. The patient denies any other symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, or malaise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills. Endorses weight loss. Endorses fatigue.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.
• Respiratory:   Endorses shortness of breath with seasonal changes.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena.
• Genitourinary: Denies abnormal bleeding between menses.
• Neurological: Positive for dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. No gallops or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Gastrointestinal: Tenderness to palpation to the right lower quadrant.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1c is 8.2.
Labs are within normal limits.
Anemia labs: Still pending.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Joyce Price is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure, who presents for follow up of abnormal labs.

1. Abnormal labs.
• Medical Reasoning: Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2. Her available anemia labs were normal, but we need to wait for her pending labs for a definitive anemia diagnosis.
• Additional Testing: I would like to obtain an endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
• Specialist Referrals: We will put in a referral to gastroenterology to perform her endoscopy and colonoscopy.

2. COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. She ceased tobacco use several years ago and continues to abstain from this.
• Medical Treatment: I do not think she needs any inhalers at this time. She should continue to stay away from smoking.

3. Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and continues to follow dietary modifications, particularly with limiting her sodium intake.
• Medical Treatment: Continue on Toprol and lisinopril, as well as her current dose of Lasix 20 mg a day.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up of abnormal lab finding (low hemoglobin).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD and congestive heart failure presents for follow-up of an abnormal lab finding (low hemoglobin). Patient reports significant fatigue and decreased energy over the past couple of months, worsening over the past month, which has impacted her ability to maintain her usual exercise routine (running, climbing 1-2 hours/day). She reports slight weight loss, which she attributes to increased exercise prior to the onset of severe fatigue. She denies blood in her stools, dark/charry/black stools, or increased spotting with periods. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath (except seasonal), fever, chills, or body aches.

Patient reports her COPD is stable; she quit smoking cold turkey several years ago and continues to abstain. She notes seasonal breathing difficulty which she attributes to allergies.

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Evelyn Morris is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc. She presents for her annual exam.

The patient states she has been doing okay with her herniated disc in her back. She has not had any back pain or any limitations in movement. She had a steroid injection for her herniated disc several months ago, which has been doing well.

Her right carpal tunnel release was performed a couple of years ago and she is back to work. She has full range of motion and it feels really good. No numbness or tingling in her hands.

She has had prior stenting for her heart and heart vessels in the past. Over the last month, she reports chest pain approximately 3-4 times a week with ambulation. Her chest pain does resolve with rest. The pain is described as burning and is located in the middle of her chest. She denies pain at rest.

She has had a little bit of nasal congestion from allergies. The patient denies, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or lower extremity edema.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.
• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion form allergies.
• Cardiovascular: Denies dyspnea. Endorses chest pain with exertion.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.
• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

ECG prior coronary artery disease. No new changes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Evelyn Morris is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc. She presents for her annual exam.

Status post right carpal tunnel release.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well postoperatively. She has returned to work and denies any recurrent symptoms.

Herniated disc.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been asymptomatic since receiving a steroid injection several months ago. I do not think we need to refer her for any further steroid injections or physical therapy at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: If she has any recurrent symptoms, she will let me know and we can take it from there.

Coronary artery disease.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports a burning chest pain with exertion approximately 3 times per week for the past month. Her recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%.
• Medical Treatment: Continue aspirin and Toprol. Initiate Crestor 20 mg once daily.
• Additional Testing: We will order a cardiac stress test and a lipid panel for further evaluation.

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with some joint pain.

The patient reports he has been "" putting a few more miles on the bike each day "". His bilateral knees have been sore in the last 3 to 4 days. He states his bilateral knees are equally painful. He notes stiffness and soreness in the morning and, by the end of the day, he feels the same sensation. He endorses swelling and redness in his knees which reduces in severity by the afternoon. The patient denies any other associated fatigue. He denies any injury to his knees. He denies pain in any other joints including his elbows, wrists, or shoulders.

In regards to his coronary artery disease, Mr. Moore states he is compliant with his aspirin and Crestor. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient denies recent symptoms related to his lupus over the last year.

He denies fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomitting.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and erythema in bilateral knees.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: Edema and slight erythema of bilateral knees. Slight effusion of the right knee with pain to palpation. Decreased range of motion in bilateral knees.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. No bony abnormalities or fractures were noted.

Electrocardiogram stable in comparison to last year.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with some joint pain.

Lupus.
• Medical Reasoning: This has been stable and asymptomatic for the past year, but the patient reports increased joint pain and inflammation in his bilateral knees lately. ​His recent knee x-ray was unremarkable, so I am concerned that this is a lupus flare.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.

Coronary artery disease.
• Medical Reasoning: He is asymptomatic at this time. He has discontinued Plavix but continues with daily aspirin and Crestor. His recent EKG was unremarkable.
• Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel and a repeat echocardiogram.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with bilateral knee pain. The pain has been present for the last 3 to 4 days. He reports the pain is equally severe in both knees. He describes the pain as stiffness and soreness, particularly noticeable upon waking in the morning and again by the end of the day, around dinner time. He notes his knees appear ""a little inflamed"" in the morning, which is less noticeable by the afternoon. The patient attributes the onset of pain to increasing his daily mileage on his bike as part of his workout routine, stating he ""probably doubled the miles."" He denies any specific injury preceding the pain. He denies pain in any other joints, including elbows, wrists, or shoulders. He denies associated symptoms such as fatigue or fever.

Patient reports compliance with his daily aspirin and Crestor for his coronary artery disease. He denies current chest pain or shortness of breath.
Patient reports no issues related to his lupus in the last year or so.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Denies fever. Denies fatigue.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. Denies shortness of breath.
Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi mentioned.
Musculoskeletal:
Knees: Bilateral edema and slight erythema noted. Slight effusion present on the right knee. Pain to palpation of the right knee. Decreased range of motion of the knees bilaterally.
Other joints: Not examined/discussed in transcript.
Other systems: Not examined/discussed in transcript.

RESULTS:
Right Knee X-ray: Reviewed, unremarkable. No bony abnormality or fracture noted.
Electrocardiogram (recent): Reviewed, noted as ""really good,"" no concerns from a heart standpoint.

A:
1. Bilateral Knee Pain, likely secondary to Lupus flare vs. overuse/inflammatory arthritis: 57-year-old male with history of lupus and recent increase in cycling activity presents with acute onset bilateral knee pain, stiffness, swelling, erythema, effusion (R knee), and decreased range of motion. Unremarkable knee x-ray rules out fracture or significant bony abnormality. Given the history of lupus and inflammatory signs on exam, a lupus flare is a concern, though overuse from increased activity is also a contributing factor.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: Stable. Patient reports compliance with aspirin and Crestor. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Recent EKG and vital signs are reassuring.

P:
1. Bilateral Knee Pain:
    - Order autoimmune panel to evaluate for lupus flare.
    - Discussed possibility of lupus flare vs. overuse injury.
    - (No specific treatment recommendations like RICE, NSAIDs, or activity modification were discussed in the transcript).
2. Coronary Artery Disease:
    - Continue current medication regimen (Aspirin, Crestor).
    - Order lipid panel.
    - Order repeat echocardiogram.
    - Discussed stability based on patient report, vitals, and EKG.
Follow-up: Patient to be checked out by the nurse. (No specific return visit or follow-up timeframe discussed in transcript).","S – Subjective: Patient reports bilateral knee pain exacerbated by increased biking mileage over the past 3-4 days. Pain is worse in the morning (stiffness/soreness) and by dinner. Knees are slightly inflamed in the morning, with mild swelling in the afternoon. No other joints affected. No fever, fatigue, or injury.  

O – Objective: Bilateral edema and slight erythema noted. Right knee has effusion and pain on palpation. Decreased range of motion bilaterally. X-ray of right knee shows no bony abnormalities. EKG normal. Vital signs normal.

Follow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.

The patient’s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.

She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.

The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.

Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.

She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.

The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Peripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Current tobacco smoker.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Metoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Amlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Atorvastatin tablet.
Metformin.
Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.

VITALS

Blood pressure 140/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
No rasping, wheezing.

Cardiovascular
Normal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.

Gastrointestinal
No nausea or vomiting.

Extremities
Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.
Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.

ASSESSMENT

• Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Peripheral vascular disease.

PLAN

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don’t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.

Peripheral vascular disease
I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.

Hypertension
Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.

Hyperlipidemia
I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Follow-up for diabetes management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female presenting for follow-up of chronic medical conditions, primarily diabetes mellitus. Patient reports her most recent Hemoglobin A1C was 9.9, indicating poor glycemic control. She states she is currently taking glimepiride 2 mg daily and was instructed to increase the dose to 4 mg twice daily after her last visit, but she did not do so. She reports limited dietary changes, avoiding pasta and rarely eating bread (prefers wheat when she does), and drinks club soda/seltzer instead of regular soda. She denies headaches, dizziness, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or other GI symptoms. She reports a recent productive cough with clear sputum, which she attributes to congestion, and denies associated fever, chills, or shortness of breath. She notes a slower urinary stream, increased frequency during the day, and occasional nocturia, attributing these symptoms to age and evening fluid intake. She reports bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which limits her walking, but states she is walking as tolerated. She reports her vision is better after recent cataract surgery but is not happy with one lens. She confirms compliance with her blood pressure medications (metoprolol, lisinopril/HCTZ, amlodipine) and reports a home blood pressure reading of 116 a few weeks ago. She confirms compliance with atorvastatin for cholesterol. She continues to smoke cigarettes and is not ready to quit, although she agreed to think about it.

"[doctor] patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
[doctor] hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?
[patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
[doctor] so it's in both of your hands ?
[patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
[doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
[doctor] constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
[patient] yep , that's all correct .
[doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[doctor] okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[doctor] all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
[patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[doctor] and how about the left side ?
[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
[doctor] all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?
[doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[patient] that sounds fine to me .
[doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .
[patient] thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Numbness and tingling of both hands.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.
• Eyes: Floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.
• Respiratory: Shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.
• Endocrine: Excessive hunger.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up after EMG testing.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Numbness and tingling of both hands.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred for evaluation of numbness and tingling in both hands. Symptoms began a few weeks prior to presentation, approximately one year after he sustained bilateral wrist fractures in a motor vehicle accident in December 2019. He notes the symptoms became more noticeable after the wrists healed. The numbness and tingling are present in both hands, radiating from the middle and ring fingers up the forearm on the right, and from the pinky and ring fingers on the left. He states the right side is worse than the left, consistent with the more severe injury to the right wrist in the accident. He reports wearing a splint on the right wrist consistently and on the left wrist intermittently, stating the splint helps alleviate symptoms. Symptoms have worsened over the last month. He describes the sensation primarily as soreness, sometimes throbbing, and notes his hands feel weaker, especially with use. The tingling is more prominent when the hands hurt, and feels ""dull"" when the pain subsides. Symptoms occur throughout the day but are worse at night. He denies complete loss of sensation but feels his hands may be less sensitive than they should be. He also reports mild stiffness in his neck, noting he hit his head during the accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He was prescribed nerve pain medicine but reports he has not been taking it as directed.

**Past Medical History:** Hypertension, Anxiety, Prediabetes (controlled by diet), Bilateral wrist fractures (December 2019), Head contusion (December 2019).
**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.
**Family History:** Not discussed.
**Social History:** Not discussed.

**Medications:**
Coreg (for hypertension)
Lexapro (for anxiety)
Nerve pain medicine (not taking as directed)

**Allergies:** Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
Constitutional: Fatigue, weight gain.
Eyes: Floaters.
Cardiovascular: Shortness of breath, leg swelling.
Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, bloating.
Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
Integumentary: Nail bed changes, dryness, itching.
Endocrine: Excessive hunger.
Remainder of review of systems negative as per patient confirmation.

O:
**Vitals:** Not discussed.
**Physical Exam:**
Neurologic:
Sensation: Pin prick sensation diminished in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right. Sensation decreased in the 4th and 5th fingers on the left.
Reflexes: 1+ and symmetric throughout, 2+ at the knees.
Toes: Downgoing bilaterally.
Tinel's Sign: Positive at both wrists and both elbows, eliciting a ""zing"" sensation radiating up the wrist and into the elbow bilaterally.
Rest of exam noted as normal by clinician, specific components not detailed in transcript.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Syndrome vs. Bilateral Cubital Tunnel Syndrome:** Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male presenting with bilateral hand numbness and tingling, radiating into the forearms, which began after bilateral wrist fractures. Subjective report of symptoms involving the middle/ring fingers on the right and pinky/ring fingers on the left, coupled with objective findings of diminished pin prick sensation in the 3rd/4th fingers right and decreased sensation in the 4th/5th fingers left, and positive Tinel's signs at both wrists and elbows, suggest nerve compression. The symptom presentation is more suggestive of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, potentially aggravated by the past trauma. Bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome is also considered in the differential diagnosis.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Bilateral Carpal/Cubital Tunnel Syndrome:**
    *   Diagnosis and potential etiologies (carpal vs cubital tunnel syndrome, relation to past trauma) discussed with the patient.
    *   Further testing indicated to precisely locate the site of nerve irritation.
    *   Order EMG test to measure nerve responsiveness.
    *   Patient instructed to continue wearing splints.
    *   **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up visit after EMG testing is complete to review results and determine further management.
    *   **Future Management (if still symptomatic):** Consider referral to Hand Clinic or Orthopedics for potential interventions such as injections or carpal tunnel release surgery.","S – Subjective  
Numbness and tingling in both hands for several weeks, worsening over the last month. Symptoms began after a car wreck in December when the patient broke both wrists. Wears splints on both wrists (right worse, left sometimes). Reports mild neck stiffness from the accident. Takes Coreg for hypertension, Lexapro for anxiety, and previously had prediabetes under control via diet. Symptoms include soreness, occasional throbbing, and weakness, especially with hand use. Tingling more pronounced when sore, duller when symptoms subside. Symptoms occur at night and throughout the day. No reported loss of sensation, though hands feel less sensitive. Nerve pain medicine not taken as prescribed.  

O – Objective  
Sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers (right), fourth and fifth fingers (left). Reflexes: 1+ and symmetric biceps, 2+ knees; toes downgoing bilaterally. Tinel sign positive at both wrists and elbows. Review of systems: fatigue, weight gain, excessive appetite, floaters, shortness of breath, leg swelling, hunger, nail bed changes, dryness, itching, gout, muscle pain. No other systemic findings.  

A – Assessment  
Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. Symptom presentation suggests carpal tunnel syndrome due to nerve irritation at wrists, likely secondary to prior trauma.  

P – Plan  
Schedule EMG test to assess nerve responsiveness. Follow-up after studies; if symptoms persist, consider referral to hand clinic for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery, or orthopedist. Continue wearing splints."

Upper extremity tingling

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 60-year-old female referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began last December after she broke both wrists in an MVA and which has progressively worsened since then. She continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which she states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the MVA. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. She states that her fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. She denies complete loss of sensation in any of her fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. she reports mild stiffness in her neck. She notes that she did hit her head during the MVA and was diagnosed with a contusion. She states that she has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

The patient takes carvedilol for her hypertension and Lexapro for her anxiety. She reports a history of prediabetes, which she has brought under control via dietary changes. She denies any history of thyroid issues.

[doctor] i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] how can i help you today ?
[patient] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.

The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.

Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Anxiety.

Surgical
Surgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”

Procedures
Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Works as a paralegal.

FAMILY HISTORY

Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

ALLERGIES

Seasonal environmental allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.
• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.
• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.

• GERD
• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

PLAN

• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.
• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.
• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.
• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.
• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.
• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.
• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.
• Schedule EGD.
• Call with any changes or problems.
• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Acid reflux.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Michelle King is a 35-year-old female presenting for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux, referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott. She reports a history of acid reflux since approximately age 12, which has worsened over the past few years. She describes the sensation as burning in her chest and throat. She denies difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. She also denies unintentional weight loss but notes a poor appetite for the past two months, attributing it to significant work stress as a paralegal.

Her symptoms are exacerbated by stress and certain foods, including spicy foods, soda (carbonated beverages), citrus products, and tomato-based products, although she admits to still consuming these occasionally.

She has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately one year. She feels it provides some relief, noting some days are asymptomatic, but others are severely affected, particularly after eating certain foods. She previously tried omeprazole concurrently with ranitidine, which she felt helped. She denies having had an upper endoscopy (EGD) in the last 10 years, though she may have had one when she was younger.

**Past Medical History:** Anxiety, seasonal allergies.

**Past Surgical History:** Abdominal surgery as an infant (around one month old) for ""twisted intestines.""

**Family History:** Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer. Mother had acid reflux and took medication to coat the stomach lining.

**Social History:** Works as a paralegal. Reports significant work stress.

**Current Medications:** Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

**Allergies:** Seasonal environmental allergies (reaction not specified).

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Positive for poor appetite. Denies unintentional weight loss.
*   **HEENT:** Positive for burning sensation in throat.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Positive for burning sensation in chest (heartburn). Denies abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding.
*   **Psychiatric:** Positive for stress and anxiety.
*   **Allergic/Immunologic:** Positive for seasonal allergies.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
*   **General:** Normal per new patient template (details not specified in transcript).
*   **Abdomen:** Well-healed surgical scar noted.

**Vitals:** Not discussed in transcript.
**Labs/Imaging:** Not discussed in transcript.

A:
The patient is a 35-year-old female presenting with a several-year history of GERD, characterized by burning chest and throat pain, which has worsened recently and is poorly controlled despite omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. She identifies dietary triggers (spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, tomato products) and stress as exacerbating factors. Pertinent negatives include the absence of dysphagia, abdominal pain, GI bleeding symptoms, and unintentional weight loss, which are reassuring concerning alarm symptoms. Family history is notable for maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer and mother with acid reflux. Physical exam reveals a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

Based on the history of poorly controlled symptoms on high-dose PPI and family history, GERD is the primary diagnosis. An underlying functional etiology is also suspected given the symptom profile and reported stress/anxiety. The lack of alarm symptoms is reassuring, but the family history warrants further investigation.

**Problem List:**
1.  Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), poorly controlled on high-dose PPI.
2.  Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

P:
**GERD / Suspected Functional Etiology:**
*   **Medication:** Discontinue omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. Start Nexium (esomeprazole) 40 mg twice daily. Prescription sent to patient's pharmacy on file.
*   **Lifestyle/Dietary Modifications:** Patient educated on the importance of avoiding identified trigger foods (spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, tomato products) and managing stress, as these can exacerbate GERD symptoms even on PPI therapy. Patient is agreeable to improving adherence to dietary changes.
*   **Procedure:** Recommend Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate for potential causes of refractory GERD, including ulcers, erosions, or precancerous/cancerous conditions, and to obtain biopsies if indicated. Procedure risks were discussed, and the patient is agreeable and will schedule at checkout.
*   **Further Workup (Contingent):** If EGD is normal and symptoms persist despite trial of Nexium, consider trial of Protonix (pantoprazole) and obtaining a pH-impedance study to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and differentiate between functional heartburn and hypersensitivity.
*   **Follow-up:** Patient to follow up in clinic after the EGD to discuss results and assess response to medication and lifestyle changes.
*   **Instructions:** Patient instructed to call the office if symptoms change or worsen, or if any problems arise before the EGD or follow-up appointment.","S – Subjective  
Patient reports a 12-year history of acid reflux, which has worsened over the past few years. Currently takes 40 mg omeprazole BID, but symptoms are not fully controlled. Describes chest and throat burning, triggered by spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods. Denies dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements. Notes stress and anxiety as exacerbating factors. Work-related stress has reduced appetite for 2 months. Family history of esophageal cancer (mother’s side) and maternal history of acid reflux. Had abdominal surgery at age 1 month for intestinal twisting. Previously on omeprazole and ranitidine, which provided some relief.  

O – Objective  
Physical exam: normal, except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars. No abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, or other abnormalities. Weight stable; denies unintentional weight loss. No signs of dysphagia, rectal bleeding, or other GI symptoms.  

A – Assessment  
GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) with possible functional etiology. No evidence of dysphagia or weight loss. Family history of GI malignancy and prior surgery.  

P – Plan  
Switch omeprazole to Nexium 40 mg BID. Schedule upper endoscopy (EGD) for evaluation of GERD and potential underlying pathology. Follow-up in office for EGD results and discussion of dietary, stress, and medication management. If EGD is normal but symptoms persist, consider trial of protonix and pH-impedance study to differentiate functional etiology from hypersensitivity."

[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Quadriplegia.
Spinal cord injury.
Hypertension.
Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

INSTRUCTIONS

Labs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up regarding recent hospitalization for suspected UTI vs. constipation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Michelle King is a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury, presenting for follow-up after a hospitalization at District Regional Hospital from 06/29/2021 to 07/02/2021. She was admitted with increasing concerns for spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. She was evaluated in the emergency department due to labile blood pressure, headache, and vomiting. During that admission, she was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Concerns for urinary tract infection were raised, and she was treated with IV antibiotic therapy. Urine cultures were obtained and reviewed. She has a suprapubic catheter. She was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient reports feeling back to her normal self. She states she does not believe her hospitalization was due to a urinary tract infection, but rather severe constipation. She reports telling the ED team she was constipated, but they did not agree, although they did perform x-rays. She states she had minimal bowel movements while hospitalized and experienced a ""massive poop"" upon returning home, after which she felt ""much better."" She currently takes Miralax daily for constipation and uses Lactulose as a ""rescue type thing"" when she doesn't go, noting it takes about two days to work and can be ""brutal."" She reports she had not had a regular bowel movement for a while leading up to the hospitalization, despite her regimen. She denies any pain or discomfort today.

The patient is unvaccinated for COVID-19. She expresses concerns about unknown long-term side effects and reports hearing about ""vaccine injury."" She believes she is young and healthy enough to beat COVID-19, despite her limited respiratory status, and takes Vitamin C and multivitamins. She denies receiving the annual flu shot.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Quadriplegia
Spinal cord injury
Chronic constipation
Autonomic dysreflexia

MEDICATIONS:
Miralax daily by mouth
Lactulose as needed by mouth

ALLERGIES:
Not mentioned.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Denies pain or discomfort today. (Other general symptoms like fever, diaphoresis, lightheadedness reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
HEENT: Denies headache today. (Headache reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
Respiratory: Lungs clear on exam today. (Limited respiratory status mentioned by patient).
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or palpitations. (Labile blood pressure reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
Gastrointestinal: Reports chronic constipation managed with Miralax and Lactulose. (Vomiting reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
Neurological: Reports history of spasms (in HPI related to hospitalization).

O:
VITALS: Not recorded/discussed.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Other systems (HEENT, CV, Abdomen, Neuro, Extremities, Skin): Not performed/discussed.
REVIEW OF HISTORICAL DATA (from hospitalization 06/29-07/02/2021):
WBC: 23,000 (elevated).
Urine Culture: Not impressive.
Abdominal X-ray: Performed in ED (findings not discussed).

A:
1. Acute on chronic constipation vs. Autonomic Dysreflexia related to constipation.
    - Patient presents for follow-up after hospitalization for symptoms including labile blood pressure, headache, vomiting, and elevated WBC, initially suspected to be UTI but patient believes was secondary to severe constipation.
    - Patient reports significant improvement in symptoms after a large bowel movement post-discharge, supporting her hypothesis.
    - Review of historical data shows elevated WBC (23k) and unimpressive urine cultures during hospitalization, making UTI less likely the sole cause.
    - Discussion regarding potential link between severe constipation/inflammation and elevated WBC was held.
    - Patient maintains a regular bowel regimen with Miralax daily and Lactulose PRN.
2. Quadriplegia (Underlying condition contributing to autonomic dysreflexia and bowel dysfunction).
3. COVID-19 Vaccine Status - Discussion and Counseling.
    - Patient is unvaccinated due to concerns about long-term side effects and belief in personal resilience and supplements.
    - Counseling provided regarding increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection given quadriplegia status and the benefits of vaccination as the primary preventative measure.

P:
1. Acute on chronic constipation / Autonomic Dysreflexia:
    - Continue current bowel regimen (Miralax daily, Lactulose PRN) as patient feels it is generally effective.
    - Patient education provided regarding potential link between dehydration, heat, and exacerbation of constipation.
    - Order fasting labs including CBC and lipid panel to be drawn in 2-3 weeks.
    - Rationale: Repeat CBC to assess trend of WBC towards normalization; lipid panel due for routine screening.
2. Quadriplegia:
    - Continue management as per patient's established care.
3. COVID-19 Vaccine Status:
    - Patient counseled on risks of COVID-19 infection given quadriplegia and benefits of vaccination.
    - Patient advised to consider vaccination as the most effective preventative measure.
    - Patient understands decision is personal.
4. Follow-up:
    - Return to clinic in 2-3 weeks for follow-up visit after labs are drawn to review results and reassess symptoms.","S – Subjective  
Patient reported hospitalization due to constipation, not a UTI. Symptoms included spasms, lightheadedness, constipation, diaphoresis, fever, elevated WBC (23,000), labile BP, headache, and vomiting. Improved after a bowel movement. Noted constipation as likely cause of BP fluctuations. Believed dysreflexia could affect WBC, but doctor clarified it typically does not. Patient confirmed urine cultures were not impressive. Discussed hot weather, dehydration, and constipation as possible contributors. Stated regular Miralax use and lactulose for severe constipation. Hesitant about COVID-19 vaccine, citing concerns about side effects and ""vaccine injury.""  

O – Objective  
History of quadriplegia, supra-pubic catheter. Previous ER admission (06/29/2021) with fever, elevated WBC, labile BP, headache, vomiting. Discharged after improvement. Current: no pain, normal vital signs. Uses Miralax daily, lactulose for severe constipation. No active symptoms. Doctor noted hot weather as potential contributor to dehydration and constipation.  

A – Assessment  
Constipation likely caused hospitalization, not UTI. Elevated WBC may reflect inflammation from constipation. No evidence of active infection. Patient at high risk for COVID-19 due to quadriplegia. Leukocytosis may resolve with constipation management.  

P – Plan  
Schedule labs (CBC, cholesterol) in 2–3 weeks. Discuss COVID-19 vaccine, recommend vaccination despite hesitance. Monitor for new symptoms. Reiterate constipation management with Miralax and lactulose."

"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .

Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had ""a lot of infections"". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.

Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.

When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.

The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.

FAMILY HISTORY

Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.
Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.

No family history of polycystic kidney disease.

CMP, 03/22/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Renal hypoplasia.
Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.

PLAN

Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.

The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

**History of Present Illness:** Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, presenting for evaluation of an abnormal renal ultrasound revealing an atrophic right kidney. Approximately [Duration not specified in transcript] ago, Ashley experienced sudden onset, severe right-sided abdominal pain, described as so bad she was bent over. She was initially evaluated and treated for a stomach virus with fluids, but symptoms worsened the following day. A repeat evaluation included an ultrasound which identified the kidney abnormality (right kidney atrophic/smaller, left kidney larger/hypertrophied). She continued to experience significant pain and vomiting and was seen at multiple facilities, including one in Jacksonville where she was told the right kidney was likely not working and described as atrophic. Further imaging reportedly found cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations, swollen lymph nodes, and signs of infection. After traveling to Atlanta and receiving treatment over four days, her acute symptoms improved, and she has had no vomiting since. However, she continues to complain of significant stomach pain and burning, especially when eating. She also reports urinary hesitancy, sometimes finding it hard to start urination, and occasional burning with urination (dysuria), particularly after drinking certain beverages like soda. She denies blood in her urine.

The family reports that prior to this acute illness, Ashley was generally healthy. They were told that a severe infection at some point may have affected her kidney. They recall that at age 4, Ashley was hospitalized 3-4 times over a couple of months for recurrent fevers and symptoms, treated with fluids and antibiotics without a specific workup for the source of infection. Symptoms would recur 1-2 weeks after discharge, then spontaneously resolved. The current doctor suspects her kidney issues may date back to this period.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Recurrent fevers/illnesses requiring hospitalization at age 4.
*   Previously healthy prior to current acute illness.

*   Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal on auscultation.
*   Respiratory: Lungs clear on auscultation.
*   Other systems: Within normal limits (as stated by clinician).

**Vital Signs:** Not explicitly stated with values in transcript. Blood pressure noted by clinician as looking ""good"".

**Laboratory and Imaging Results (Discussed in transcript):**
*   Renal Ultrasound: Abnormal, showing atrophic right kidney and hypertrophic left kidney.
*   CT Abdomen and Pelvis: Mentioned as performed.
*   Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Mentioned as performed. Results discussed: Kidney function looks good, Creatinine 0.62, estimated GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m², normal serum electrolytes and acid base status.
*   Urinalysis: Mentioned as performed. Results discussed: Without sediment (implied normal).
*   Genetic Panel: Performed by geneticist. Results discussed: No clinically significant mutations found.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Right Renal Hypoplasia/Atrophy with Left Compensatory Hypertrophy:** 14-year-old female with known structural kidney abnormality discovered during evaluation for acute abdominal pain. Imaging confirms a small, atrophic right kidney and compensatory hypertrophy of the left kidney. The etiology is suspected to be related to a severe infection experienced in early childhood, based on history of recurrent hospitalizations at age 4. Currently, kidney function (Cr, GFR, electrolytes, acid base) and blood pressure are normal, and urinalysis is unremarkable. Genetic workup was negative for significant mutations. Patient is identified as being at higher risk for developing hypertension and proteinuria in the future.
2.  **Persistent Abdominal Pain, Burning, and Urinary Symptoms:** Patient reports ongoing stomach pain and burning, urinary hesitancy, and occasional dysuria despite resolution of acute vomiting. These symptoms persist following the acute illness that led to the discovery of the kidney abnormality. The burning with urination is noted to be exacerbated by certain drinks.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Right Renal Hypoplasia/Atrophy with Left Compensatory Hypertrophy:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Annual follow-up recommended including renal ultrasound to monitor kidney size and function, urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood, and blood pressure check.
    *   **Medication Management:** Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; use Tylenol for pain/fever instead.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:**
        *   Hydration: Encourage staying well-hydrated, especially during sports activities, aiming for at least 2 liters of water per day to avoid dehydration which can strain the kidneys.
        *   Diet/Activity: Continue healthy diet and active lifestyle to support overall health and potentially mitigate future kidney risks.
2.  **Persistent Abdominal Pain, Burning, and Urinary Symptoms:**
    *   Continue encouraging adequate hydration, particularly with water, avoiding beverages that exacerbate symptoms (e.g., soda).
    *   Patient and family instructed to call if symptoms worsen or if new questions arise.
3.  **Follow-up:** Patient does not require follow-up with pediatric nephrology at this time. Annual follow-up can be arranged with her primary care physician or a local adult nephrologist closer to home.","S – Subjective  
Ashley reports a history of an abnormal renal ultrasound revealing an atrophic right kidney. She describes intermittent stomach pain, burning sensation when urinating, and discomfort when drinking certain beverages (e.g., soda). She mentions ongoing pain in her stomach, which is not severe but persistent. She has been on Pepcid 40mg daily and Claritin for allergies. Family history includes kidney disease in her father, aunt, and cousins, as well as her mother’s breast cancer. She also notes her father had a kidney transplant that failed, and her grandfather had chronic kidney disease and dialysis dependence.  

O – Objective  
Physical exam: well-appearing, alert, oriented, no acute distress. Lungs and heart sounds normal. No blood in urine.

Low back pain, left side.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.

The patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, left side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.","S:

[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions

She denies tingling but reports some numbing in her toes. She reports being able to move her ankle ""a little bit"". She took Tylenol for the pain, which provided no relief. She reports having had a fever since the injury occurred. Patient reports mountain biking for approximately three years.

**Medications:** Tylenol (dose/frequency not specified) - taken for pain, no relief.
**Allergies:** None mentioned.
**Past Medical History:** Not discussed.
**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.
**Family History:** Not discussed.
**Social History:** Not discussed beyond mechanism of injury.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Reports fever.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports right ankle pain, difficulty walking, limping, decreased movement.
*   **Neurological:** Reports some numbing in toes.
*   (Other systems not discussed).

O:
**Vital Signs:** Temperature 98.6 F, Blood Pressure 118/77, Heart Rate 77 bpm.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Right Ankle:** Edema and erythema noted on the lateral malleolus. Associated ecchymosis and a few excoriations present. Pain to palpation of the right lateral malleolus. Decreased range of motion including flexion, extension, internal rotation, and external rotation.

[patient] yeah i think i have to
[doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay

Follow up.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports an myocardial infarction.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports stent placement in the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient is a fan of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. He also enjoys swimming.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Brilinta twice a day every 12 hours, aspirin 81 mg at night, Crestor 40 mg once a day, and Toprol 50 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath with exertion.
Skin: Denies redness or infection in the right wrist.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 127/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. No gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Right radial artery cardiac catheterization site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable radial pulse.

RESULTS

The ejection fraction, obtained while he was hospitalized, was measured at approximately 50%, which is in the low normal range.

I reviewed the patient’s recent echocardiogram which demonstrates mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. His catheterization site is healing well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of continuing to take his medications to prevent the stent from clogging again and to reduce his chance of another heart attack. I encouraged him to limit his salt intake as an increased amount of sodium can affect the ejection fraction measurement of his heart function.
- Medical Treatment: The patient is taking a low-dose aspirin, and will continue taking it for life or until he is instructed to discontinue. Continue Brilinta for at least 1 year. Continue Crestor 40 mg once a day. Continue Toprol 50 mg once a day. The patient can resume swimming a few laps. He will enroll in cardiac rehab to gain confidence in returning to exercising and for dietary education and counseling. Liver function studies and lipid panel ordered. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be performed in 6 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 6 weeks to review his studies.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up visit after recent myocardial infarction and stent placement.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a follow-up approximately two weeks status post inferior myocardial infarction requiring stent placement in the right coronary artery via radial artery approach. Patient reports feeling ""okay"" and ""better than I did,"" but not yet ""perfect."" He has been taking it easy, doing very light work, and mostly sitting around and taking medications as instructed. He denies any chest pain since the stent was placed. He notes some soreness at the wrist site immediately after the procedure, but this has resolved and the site appears to be healing well without redness or signs of infection. He reports experiencing shortness of breath when going up and down stairs, but is otherwise limiting activity. He is adherent with all prescribed medications. He reports attempting to watch his diet, eating lots of vegetables and chicken without salt, but admits to having eaten pizza a few times on weekends.

**Past Medical History:** Inferior Myocardial Infarction (recent).
**Past Surgical History:** Stent placement, Right Coronary Artery (recent, via radial artery).

**Social History:** Reports being a fan of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. Enjoys swimming. Reports trying to watch salt intake in diet.

**Medications:**
Aspirin 81 mg PO nightly
Brilinta (Ticagrelor) PO twice a day every 12 hours
Crestor (Rosuvastatin) 40 mg PO once a day
Toprol (Metoprolol Tartrate) 50 mg PO once a day

**Allergies:** None mentioned.

**Review of Systems:**
General: Reports feeling okay, not perfect.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain since stent placement.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath with exertion (going up/down stairs). Denies cough, wheezing.
Skin: Reports wrist site healing well, denies redness or infection.

O:
**Vitals:**
Blood Pressure: 127/60

**Physical Exam:**
Neck: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Musculoskeletal: Right radial artery cardiac catheterization site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable radial pulse present.

**Results:**
Ejection Fraction: Approximately 50% (low normal) from recent hospitalization.
Echocardiogram: Recent study shows mild mitral regurgitation.

A:
1. Inferior Myocardial Infarction, status post PCI with stent: Patient is approximately two weeks post-MI and stent placement, reporting improvement in overall feeling and resolution of chest pain since the procedure. He is adherent with medical therapy. He reports exertional shortness of breath which is being addressed with activity recommendations and planned cardiac rehab. The radial access site is healing well.
2. Mild Mitral Regurgitation: New finding identified on recent echocardiogram, likely contributing to the systolic murmur noted on exam. This is noted as a ""little floppy valve"" and will be monitored.

P:
1. Inferior Myocardial Infarction, status post PCI with stent:
    *   **Medications:** Continue current regimen: Aspirin 81mg PO daily (lifelong), Brilinta PO BID (for at least 1 year), Crestor 40mg PO QD, Toprol 50mg PO QD. Emphasized importance of medication adherence to prevent stent thrombosis and future events.
    *   **Activity:** Patient cleared to resume swimming, starting with a few laps.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Enroll in Cardiac Rehabilitation for supervised exercise, confidence building, and dietary education/counseling.
    *   **Diet:** Continue to watch salt intake. Encouraged current efforts with vegetables and lean protein. Discussed allowing occasional small treats like a piece of pizza but emphasizing overall healthy eating.
    *   **Monitoring:** Order Liver Function Studies and Lipid Panel to follow up on medication effects and risk factors.
2. Mild Mitral Regurgitation:
    *   **Monitoring:** Order repeat Echocardiogram in approximately 6 months to assess valve function.

**Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 6 weeks to review lab results and overall progress.","S – Subjective
